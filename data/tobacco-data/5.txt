of "new levels of growth and
prosperity" for the tobaceo in-
dustry "once it is freed from the

Addressing the National As-

Sanford. governor of a state

Sanford said that since 1900

which cigarette smoking was on

Sanford called attention to

state which produces most of
the nation's ﬂue-cured tobacco
and manufactures so per cent

He said tobacco has been
plagued by health scares since
Sir Walter Raleigh ﬁrst import-
ed the leaf to England.

"Each century has had its
dedicated forces." he stated.
"who were positive that the
toiaceo and that immortality
and the rniilenium would some-
how be achieved if tobacco
were abolished."

Sanford said the surgeon
seneral's report states that a
established by statistical meth-
ads. and yet "as far as i can
determine. the report proceeds
to rely on statistics to arrive at
its conclusions which condemn
smoking.

"The further fact is that this
report does not specify any sub-
stance in tobacco smoke that
would account for causing a dis-
ease." Sanford added. "And
yet how many people realize
Americans to whom the report
was conveyed as an oiitcial
finding on the smoking and
health question.

"Stop smoking in only three days. No will
power or self control necessary. Proved effective

"Don’t confuse .this offer with plans, systems,
books. methods, etc., for these remedies require
that you have enough‘self-control to stop smok-
ing."

All you do, the ad says, ‘is take one “Formula
X22" pill following each meal. After only three
days, your nervous system is "fooled” into be-
lieving you are smoking your favorite cigaret,
cigar of pipe.

This sort of promotion has been mushrooming
all over the U. S. since the Surgeon General's re-
port on smokingand cancer was released early in
1964. Since January, Better Business Bureaus
throughout the ‘country have been ﬂooded with
inquiries about dozens of "new" anti-smoking pills
and lozenges, mouthwas'hes and chewing gums,
stop-smoking plans and programs costing up to
$40 and more for “the cure."

Fanciful claims by manufacturers for their
products and programs include "miracle ingredi-
ents” supposed to be “99 per cent effective" and
to “force you to quit? whether you want to or not."
New commercial “tobacco guidance centers" with
to coast—only a few of them under competent
medical supervision.

Millions of us are paying millions of dollars
for products we hope will rid us painlessly of the
cigaret habit.

We are gulping sugar pills and concoctions of
ordinary spice such as ginger, licorice, clove, cori-
ander—as well as pharmaceutical preparations-—
to stamp out? the cigaret craving.

We are taking up fake cigarets—dubbed
“smokes” or “adult paciﬁers” which contain
such non-nicotinic ingredients as methol srystals,

 

cabbage, lettuce or just ﬂavored clgaret paper-—
"smoke without fear.”

We are falling for suggestive “stop smoking"
phonograph records, recently the subject of in-
vestigation by the U. S. Post Ofﬁce.

= We are enrolling in a wide variety of so-called
“positive thinking" programs. even hypnosis. to
spirit us away from tobacco. We are devouring
no-smoke tablets and how-to-st‘opLsmoking pam-

phlets.

The three standard types of anti-smoking
medications now available are the nicotine sub-

Many. of these products do, in fact, help you ,

quit smoking temporarily. But none does the job
permanently. None works without a generous
dose of will power on your part. Most are harm-
less, but a few cases of nausea, stomach .pain and
effects.
In conclusion, the American Medical Assn. .
able to psychological suggestion would find antic
tobacco preparations to be an aid. However, ex-

must be treated as such if the individualis unable
to rid himself of-the habit voluntarily.‘

indicates that cigarette smoke
contains an eiuaant which
mnupileo the potency of a
cancer-causing chemical more
than til-told.

Mice were irritated In tho-

which is known to product I
certain number oi concern

when given in an ertabilshed

done. I
other mice were given not
only urethan but their throats

were painted five times a week

The second group developed

Gordon gladly trades bravery
for maturity, more victories
NAZARETH, Pa (AP)—— Robby
Gordon says he isn ’t qu1te as
Brave as he used to be.

But don’ t get the wrong idea.
The change is simply a measure
of the growing maturity of the 25-

“I was a braver driver three

between practice sessions for
Sunday 5 Bosch Spark Plug
Grand Prix at Nazareth Speed-

“I feel I' m a better driver today
heJ said “Most of all though, I
want to win races. When it comes
to the last 20 laps, we’re going to
just suck it up and go for it.”
, With two races remaining, Gor-

. the Indy-car circuit, is locked in a
tlght battle with Michael Andretti
and Paul Tracy for third place in
the season standings. .

“I don't even smoke that much, and I don‘t agree
with this, " said Vic Jackson, a former Brookline resi~
dent who now delivers meals on wheels in the town.

Sitting beside"Jackson was his ﬁ'lend Bob Var-
num, who also had harsh words for the ban. “I don‘t

Now Your. Nov. zit—An abun-
dance of evidence is accumulating
that shows lung cancer cannot be
explained by any single. simple
factor. such as clgsrei smoking. Dr.
Robert c. Hockett. associate sci-
entific director of the Tobacco in-
dustry Research Committee. told
the New York City Advertising
Men's Post 209 ot the American
Legion last week.

"A care is sometimes made tor
the evidence." Dr. Hockett said.
“Likewise. a case against this the-
ory can also be made by selecting
the evidence.

“But taking all the known fac-
tors in balance. one must arrive
at Lhe conclusion that the answer
or answers to human lung cancer
speculate on his not theory, in."
such opinions should not be con-
fused with races."

Describing the work of the cel-
entiiic advisory board oi' the To-
bacco Industry Research Commit-
0! nine independent. scientists has
complete freedom in the research
policy and program. and has al-
located about 52.000.000 so tar in

grants to scientists working in ed-
ucniional. medical and research in-

atilutions.
o The position 0! the board. he
said. is that so tar too little is
known about lung cancer and
heart disease to warrant any con-
causes.
“Factors statistically associated
with lung cancer do not necessari-
ly have a causative role," Dr.
Hockett said. "The signiﬁcance oi
the more recent studies is that they
show lung cancer is related to a
vast number of tactors.

mary causative role. especially
when medical science is just be-
ginning to lift the curtain on thl
unknowns about cancer."

Emphasizing that generalizatiom
about the etlects of smoking on
health are unwarranted. Dr. Hock-
ett cited a scientiﬁc paper giver
last week at the Southern Medical
Assn. meeting (AA. Nov. 18) A
study of 11,000 workers of Amer-

ican Tobacco Co. showed that do
workers smoke near-iv tic-iv“ I
much as the average smoker one
still have average or below aver~
age cancer and heart disease risk:
and live beyond the average ills

n “if nothing else." Dr. Rocket-
said. "this shows that smoking. ir
itself isn't necessarily or invaria-
bly associated with higher deatl
rates or higher risks of cancer am
heart disease." a

erful weapon to combat youth

begin. Yet each day. thousands of
children across the [5.5. try their
first Cigarette. hoping to fit in. look
cool, rebel-or simply experiment.

Fortunatelyi parents now have a
tool to help them begin a dialogue
on not smoking—the "Take 10"
instructional video featuring tips
from Dr. Michael Popkin. founder
and president of ActiVe Parenting
Publishers and the author of more
than 20 parenting books and videos.

The video is part of the "Take 10"
Inst year as part of the Lorillgrd

Most parents want family time
together to be stress-free. and check-
ing in with kids about important top—
ics like not smoking isn‘t easy

“Kids get uncomfortable easily-
and may back away from any kind
of formal discussion." says Dr.
Popkin. "Limit the ﬁrst conversuv
tion to about It) minutes-to open the
dialogue."

When there is mutual trust. open
cummunic 'on between parents and
children isn t far behind. Dr. Popkin
suggests three simple steps for

 

establishing expectations and build—‘
ing trust: ‘ V

- Listen to your child. Come
from caring. not judgement.

- Tell your child how ,you
would feel if he or she tried smok-
ing. Be careful not to lecture.

explain how disappointed you‘
would feel or what you would do if
he or she smoked.

Many parents don’t realize how
strong of an impact they can make
by spending a few minutes talking
with their kids-especially about dif-
ﬁcult topics. ,

Risk of infant

Anti-abortion activists
concerned with the well-
haps start supporting anoth- ‘
er group of protesters — the
opponents of secondhand '
smoke.

Roughly onefourth of -
American women smoke 1'0"

while pregnant and perhaps SIEOFRIED

ing pregnant women are exposed to the smoke of
others. Nicotine from this smoke makes its way to
the fetus. and medical researchers baVe document-
ed several damaging consequences. Nicotine expo-
sure has been linked to a higher rate of spontaneous
abortions. lower birth weights and a higher rate of
attention deficit disorder.

Furthermore. a study published this month
found a substantial increase in Sudden infant Death
Syndrome (commonly known as “crib death”)
among infants exposed to smoke before birth.

SIDS kills more than 5,000 babies per year in the
United States; more babies betwaen the age of 1
month and 1 year die of SIDS than from any other
cause. The causes of crib death have long been
mysterious — and in fact. part of the definition of
SIDS is that the death. is unexplained But while the

' unknown causes of SIDS aren't likely to be simple,
cigarette smoke seems to be a factor. '

Smoking by mothers. fathers or other people in
the same room with a baby greatly increases the crib
death risk. researchers from the University of Cali-
fornia. San Diego, reported last month in the Jour-
mil of the American Medical Association.

“The greater the total number of cigarettes the
infant was passively exposed to after birth from all
adulm. the higher the risk of SIDS." wrote Hillary
Sandra Klonoff-Cohen and colleagues.

Furthermore. smoke raises the risk of SIDS even
when the exposure comes before birth. When fa-
thers smoked in the presence of a nonsmoking
mother during pregnancy. for example, the risk of
infant crib death more than tripled. if the mother

of course. such research represents only an in-
dictment of cigarette smoke as a baby killer and not
yet a conviction. for a correlation is not proof of a

to 3 Tuesday to adopt. a strict
ordinance requiring employers
throughout the city to set aside
no-smok‘ing areas for their work.-

Andre’rﬁ puts an end
to Penske win streak

By The Mammal: Pm”

Michael Andretti hopes a turnaround
nating victory Sunday in the Toronto
Molson-lndy.

If it did, though, Andretti says the
reason is probably of! the track, where
Chip Ganassi Racing recently signed
veteran lndyCar engineer Mo Nunn to
help get things sorted out.

Whatever made the difference,
though, the 31-year-old Andretti was
able to outrace a variety of troubles
Sunday to end Team Penske’s seven-
race winning streak and earn his
fourth Toronto victory.

Andretti, whose best finish since an
opening-day victory in Australia was
fourth place last month at Milwaukee,
took control after bumping and passing
Nigel mnsell for the lead on lap 26 as
the defending series Champion's right-
rear tire deﬂated.

ti explained. “I tried to get past him
once and almost wound up Ln a tire
barrier. Then i tapped him a little and
Just got by him a few turns later. I
didn't know he was having any problem
with his tire. i didn’t see that.”

Andretti was virtually unchallenged
the rest of the 9&lap, tum-mile race.
heating Bobby Rahal to the finish by 6.8
seconds in earning his 29th career Indy-
Car victory.

“This is a big win for us,” Andretti
said. “We started out on a real high
with the win in Australia, then every
thing went downhill. It seemed the
harder we worked. the slower the car
would go.

fortunate that Mo Nunn left Simon Roc—
ing (last month). We went out and got
Mo to work with Julian Robertson, my
engineer all year long. They make a
super team. Hopefully, we‘re on the
way.”

Nunn was the chief engineer for Em-
erson Fittlpadli in his championship
season of 1989.

Geoff Bodine kept insisting that Koo
sler tires would withstand the rigors of
amounted to a Sunday drive in the Mill»
er Genuine Draft son at Long Pond, Pa.

The Victory at Pocono International
Raceway was the first this year for the
Indiana~based race tire manufacturer.
Cars running on the Goodyear brand
had won the first 16 races on the
NASCAR Winston Cup circuit.

“You‘re going to see a lot more ﬁne
sler cars in Victory Lane this year,‘
Bodine said. "We're proud of what (Kw
sier president) Bob Newton and his peo«
ple have done.”

Bodlne, who won the .pole in a Ford
Thunderblrd with a speed of 163.689
mph, led 156 of 200 laps and beat Ward
Burton by 1.26 seconds for his first vic-
tory this season. it was the 14th win of
Eodlne's career.

Steve Robertson of ngland extended
his point lead in the Firestone lndy
Lights racing series with a victory at

MEMO FOR WARREN & CO;

Chief Jontice Earl Warren’s commission investigating
the Kennedy assassination began work yesterday.

' ‘ Let us hope so indeed; ‘

To aid Justice War-menu and
his colleagues, we'd like to quote

Called most kindly to our attentioni by. New York's
Conservative Party, the letter was printed in-The Wan-
derer‘s Oct. 31,1963, issue, weeks beﬁdre the President
was murderedt

. . . I‘reeeive hundreda‘of lettem a year from all over
the world. even from behind the iron Curtain, fromitana‘ot

he enemies of freedom and: God are‘ everywhere in

la‘in ersonal jeopardy trons them . . . Indeed. it is very‘

proba le. Presidents‘have been murdered before in our his-

‘ ~-.tory,‘ and in less dreadtul times. Among our enemies therei
are many madmen.

I receive quite a. number of pro-Communist‘and “liBEral'”
periodicals; andisome are quite inﬂammatory . . . some of‘
our big monthly magazines. for instance—are wrathful‘
against our President;

It seems thatthey‘had expectedlhim to overthrow. that

The‘mene thought 0! Mr. Kennedy being assassinated
should make alllof‘ us shudder . . .
love such an "incident." I know. I read some of their litera-
ture. It? would delight them—and serve their‘ evil pompou—
if‘h‘srmicame to Mr. Kennedy. I have already sent a sample

It is to be hoped that the Caldivell letter. among other
factors, will impel the Warren commission to‘look deeply
into the Communist aspect‘of the assassination, and to sea
sist the attempts of such persons‘as Sen. J. W. Fulbright
(D—Alli.) to shift the blame to the so-called: radical night

Review a «triumph:
Rethinking Risk

 

gress convenes in January. one of the
what Lamar Alexander calls the
and regulations enacted into law by
the likes of Congressman Henry Wax-
man lD.. Hollywood). This is an espe~
cially pressmg priority in the environ-
mental arena. where Congress and
various executive branch agencies
have spent years passing onerous
rules to deal with negligible or nonex-
istent risks.

Environmental regulation is the
source of much public outrage nowa-
days. Often the rules are a tangled

legislation was complex in its goals '

and impossibly vague in how to meet
those goals. The real rule-making was
left to the bureaucracies. which in
turn produced their own Rube Gold»
bengian complexity. Now comes evi-
dence from a most unlikely source~
the government itself-to support the
contention that environmental spend-
ing bears little if any relation to the
real risks faced by the public.

~—L The Department of Energy has

just released a report titled “Choices
in Risk Assessment." prepared by
a nonprofit research group. The
agency has good reason to study the
subject: it could spend $300 billion to
$1 trillion over the next 30 years
cleaning up waste sites. Does the sci’
entiiic policy behind those cleanups—
and other federal actions—stand up
to scrutiny?
The report delivers some clear an-
swers: "Most environmental risks are
so small or indistinguishable that
their existence cannot be proven."
Sﬁentiiic policy is ”inherently biased
and can be designed to achieve prede-
termined regulatory outcomes." "Pol-

icy because of a lack of hill and fair
asclosure."

and used oil. for which some evidence l
of risk exists, but which on balance do
far more good than harm. The report
asks why similar decisions haven‘t
been reached about other alleged dan-
gers. For example. when the EPA
tried to ban asbestos. it took into ac»
count only the product‘s hypothetical
cancer risk—not the many lives that
would be lost if nonasbestos brakes
are substituted on cars.

There's simply no rhyme or reason
behind federal environmental policy.
Even the "one chance in a million"
standard used by many agencies to
define a minimum leVel of cancer risk
turns out to have no scientific basis.
tal consultant, reports in the newslet-
ter EPA Watch that this standard was
basically plucked out of a hat by the
FDA in the 1970s to regulate animal
drug residues. Now it's employed for
everything from hazardous waste
sites to pesticides-even though scien-
risks of less than one in a thousand
can't even be quantiﬁed. '

"It's insane that we're spending
hundreds of billions of dollars chasing

The road to sanity starts with more
rational risk/cost-beneﬁt analysis.
Bills to accomplish that goal were in»
troduced in the lust Congress but got
nowhere because of opposition from
Democratic barons. Now that there
are new Kings of the Hill. swift action
is expected on this front.

But the new Republican majority

Heimann’s New Book Traces
History of Tobacco in U. S.

By Gerard 'l'ciicy
"Tobaccos" Editor in Danville, Va.

One of the most com rehensive
works on the history of to acco has
just come oii the press of the McGraw-
a book which gives promise of being
the tobacco man's "Bible."

Entitled "Tobacco and Americans.” it
is the work of Robert K. Heimann. a
tobacco expert in the field of research
and it contains 260 pages and 300
extraordinarily good illustrations. It
sens for $7.50.

The libraries are not without boolrs
about tobacco. but this one is so
sweeping in its treatment that it will
occupy a place in many a home of
tobacco men. It begins with the dis~

ccvery by the Spanish Ereebooters and

lorers ﬁnding in South America
Esians smolring_'tnbago'. it then pro-
ing habit and the development of
America's iirst export business. _ Sir

the whole history of man's great solace

The illustrations.—many of them

Black Teen-Agers Are Turning AWay

 

By PHILIP J. HILTS

ASHINGTON. April 18
-— Mrican-American
teen-agers have large-
ly eliminated smoking

from their lives. while white teen-
agers are still taking up the habit at
high rates. according to a study re-
ported in The Journal of the National
Cancer Institute.

"This is the single most interest:

ing change in the use at tobacco in
years: the success of. black teens.”
said Dr. Michael Erlksen. chiei oi
the Oilice on Smoking and Health at

. the Federal Centers for Disease Con-

trol and Prevention in Atlanta.
“We'd like to bottle it and get it to
how to do that yet."

The trend is striking:

in lino, Federal surveys at thou-
sands of high school seniors around
the country showed that both black
and white teenagers smoked at rela-
tively high rates: 28.8 percent at
whites smoked one or more ciga-

black teen-age'rs did so.

But by 1993, only 4.4 percent 0!
black teen-tigers took up regular
smoking, according to the lnstimte
for Social Research at the Universi-
ty of Michigan. which conducts the
annual surveys for the Government. .

Among whites, the figures remains
high, at 22.9 percent in 1993, the
highest it has been since the late

1910's.

cause at higher cigarette prices or
because the teen-agers are usirlg

attitude and social norms. said Dr.
Sherry Mills, an epidemiologist who
conducted group discussions with
agers in each at live cities to deter-
mine what was behind the trend. The

Of Fannly Farm

. Tobacco may be providing a last strong-
‘ , ,hold for the traditional “family farm” in the
"United States—an institution which THE
MESSENGER hopes will never disappear.
" Stephen E Wrather, director of the tobac- .
“ cultures marketing service, made the point.
Vane disappearing at a rapid rate, up‘rooting
, ' have actually increased in number. This may
surprise some, but here are the figures:

Nearly 3,000, 000 farms have disap-
‘ " peaied since 1919, about 45 per cent of
the total; In 1919 there were 6,,500 000
US farms. Last year there were only
3,800,000. , ,. 1 .

istered a gain of'21 000 in number since

1919~from 496, 000 that year to 517,-

‘ 1 pointed out in his piecein TOBACCO NEWS,
_ from 1928 to 1935,. when the depression
' _ brought about a return to the land. After
that the downturn began at a heavier pace
than ever as farmers moved to cities for-“l.
' '1 jobs in business and industry. 1 '
__ Nearly all types of farms have been af-
a'ii‘fected. Here are a few examples of the de- 7

Corn farms dropped in number from
4, 900, 000 to 1,900,000. ' .
Wheat farms declined from 2,200,.

Cotton farms are down from 1,,900-

000 to 499, 540.

Still, while peisonal attention is still the
byword for the tobacco farmer, improved
methods and equipment have enabled him to
get bigger crop yields and a higher cash re’
turn per acre.

The TOBACCO NEWS piece pointed out
that the number of farm families who depend
‘on tobacco runs a good deal higherﬂthan the
actual number of tobacco farms, since medi-
um-size and larger acreage allotments con-

tenant families. All in all, the piece asserts,
the historical place of tobacco in American
agricultune is expected to remain stable,
which is a hope. which a lot of Hopkins coun-
tians will share. for tobacco is still an im-
portant crop in our farm economy.

Professor Sterling told the Ameri-

IS EPA BLOWING ITS OWN SMOKE?

How Much Science Is Behind Its Tobacco Finding?

By Michael Fumento

healthfhli and the way‘the government
musters its scientiﬁc case, that raises

Some scientists andi policy analysts
who say they couldniticare less about
rights of smokers are worrying aloud
that the EPA report is paving the way
for justifying new health-based‘govern-
mentiregulations and lprograms without
any real science behind them.

Watch based in Chantilly. Va., “It's
now open season on whatever contami-
nant the EPA chooses to label the killer
contaminant of the week. with the effect
that once again, Americans are going to
he stampeded into fearing‘aisubstance
are scientiﬁcally indefensible.’.‘

Yale U niversity epidemiologistiAlvan‘
Feinstein, writingin the journal Toxico-
logical Pathology; said he recently

heard a prominentileadcr in epidemio-
logy admit of the EPA‘s work on
passive smoking: “Yes. it's rotten sci-
ence, but it's in a worthy cause. ltiwill
help us to get rid of cigarettes and to
become a smoke-free society.“

Another cntrc, Alfred P. Wehner,
mental Consultants lnc., in Richland.
Washi, said; “l did work for the EPA in
the past and thoughti of them rea-
sonably well, but when l saw. that
report. I was really embarrassed. It was
a bad documents"

One thing both sides agree on is that
the direct policy ramiﬁcations of the
EPA report could be tremendous.

"You cant bet your next paycheck
that OSHA (the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration) willlban all
smoking in‘the workplace.‘.’ said John
Shanahan. the environmental policy
analyst atithe Heritage Foundation.

Although, in unveiling the report.
Reilly expressly referred to cancer in
children and in the workplace. the
statisticallanalysis in the EPA report
actually ignored the studies that looked
forisuch links.

Rather, the EPA survey is basedlon
11‘ American studies of spouses of
smokers. The report discussedibutidid
not put into its statistical analysis, the
results of l9 other studies dime outside
the US.

In its analysis ofithose ll studies, the
EPA found that there was a “statisti-
cally signiﬁcant" difference in the num-
ber of lung cancerssuffered by non-
smoking spouses of smokers, equal to
l 19 such cancers in nonsmoking spouses
of smokers compared to l00 lung
cancers in nonsmoking spouses of non-
smokers.

This ﬁnding of statistical signiﬁcance
allowed it to rank passii'e smoking as a:
Class A carcinogen, the highest risk

Statisticallsigniﬁcance, while sound-
ing like arcane academic talk, is actually
quite important. It is used to account for
the possibility that something happened

, —— inithis case the l9 additionalllung


But critics say, that, using itsown
previous statisticallstandards, the EPA
reportishows no such signiﬁcance.
“Frankly, I was embarrassedi as a
scientist with what they came up with.
The main problem was the statistical
handling oil the data," said Wehner,
who headed a panellof scientiststand
of the EPA reporli for the tobacco
industry.

‘Meta-Analysis’

One aspect of this problem, say.
critics. involves the combination‘of the
ll studies into one big group — what
the EPA called a “meta-analysis."

The EPA has never before done this.
Critics say such combinations may be
the same way, the results will be like
comparing apples and oranges and
pears.

Not everyone agrees.

Stanton Glantz of the Institute of
Health Policy Studies at the University.
of California. San Francisco.."l review
reports like that for the State of Califor.
nia. and the work the EPA did is
absolutely ﬁrsti rate, one of the best
pieces of science We seen abouti any-
thing."


“To get scientiﬁcally valid data, there
are very strict rules and requirements on
analysis. and virtually all of them were
violated in the EPA analysis,’.' he said.

‘Conﬁdence Intervals‘

The ll studies together actually
reﬂected 10 studies that showed no
statistically signiﬁcantiincreases in can-
cer and only one that did. When the
EPA says that the weight ofi ll studies
showed harm from passive smoking, it
really meant one positive combined with
10 neutrals.

More important than the use of the
meta-analysis. say critics. is the EPA's
use, also for the ﬁrst time,,of a less
rigorous statistical analysis.

Epidemiologists — those who study
disease and accident patterns to estab-
lish why they occur —— calculate “conﬁ-
dence intervals“ to express the
likelihood that a result could have

A 95% conﬁdence interval bncans that
there is a 95% possibility that the result
didn’t happen from chance, on a 5%
possibility thatiit did.

Until the passive smoking‘report, the
EPA has always used a 95% conﬁdence
interval. as have most researchers doing
the individual ETS studies were pub-
lished with 95% conﬁdence intervals. ,

Yeti inits averaging of those ETS
studies, the EPA decided‘to gotwith a
90% conﬁdence interval.

“That doubles the chance oft being
wrong," explained James Enstrom, a
professor of epidemiology‘at the Uni;
versity ol'Calllbmia, ,Los Angeles.

the conﬁdence interval. we have here a
90% conﬁdence level. And that was, in
fact,,what was recommended to us by
the scientiﬁc community as appropriate
to this data." Repeated calls to the EPA
to ﬁnd out who in the scientiﬁc commuv
nity had done so went unanswered. .

‘Haitsplittlng’ Factor
Glantz said the criticism of the change
in the conﬁdence level is at kindi of
"haiisplitting that onlyiprofessors care
about."

Many‘epidcmiologists, however, dis-
agree.

“In mosti cases, a scientist would
never do this sort of thing" Enstrom
said. “It's surprising‘th‘at they would try
to get away with it."

The bottom line is that such “hairs-
plitting“ allowed the EPA to come to a
totally, different conclusion than it
wouldi have using
its normal method.

It could now de-
s u l t s o l' t be
American studies,
when lumped to«
gether. were "sta-
t i s t i c a l l y
signiﬁcant," 3 term
of great impor-
tance to the medi-
cal community. At
a 95% conﬁdence

Leslie gets his firs
Grand National win

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

. CLERMONT, Ind. — Tracy
Leslie, taking advantage of spins
and wrecks that sidelined the
frontrunners, beat David Green to
the ﬁnish line by .73 seconds Satur-
day ni ht in winning the Kroger
200 N SCAR Grand National race


» Grand National starts for Leslie.

“1 can’t sa enough about the
crew. They di it,” Leslie said. “We
don’t know how many bumps (the
Oldsmobile) has on it and now it‘s
fit one on the root" from where

slie stood on it in victory circle.


Todd Bodine and Robert
Pressley were ﬁghting for the lead
on la 172 when the came up on
the sewer Buick 0 Troy Beebe.
Pressley’s Chevrolet took the low
side and Bodine’s Chevy the high,
and'all three spun into the wall.
Tommy Houston's Ford, running
third at the time, also became in~
volved, as did the Chevys of Lany
Pearson and Steve Grissom. A red
ﬂag was shown to stop the ﬁeld
while tracks crews cleaned up the
mess.

No drivers were hurt.

Winston Cup veteran Terry
[abonte rallied from three laps
down to take third with Burton
coming home fourth.

Polesitter Ernie Irvan was the
fastest car on the track much of the
night but his Chevy blew an engine
on lap lSl.

ead from Emerson Fittipaldi, who
struggled to a 13th~placc ﬁnish on
the hot, humid afternoon.

The Briton, who was the Fomtu—
la One champion last season, took
the lead from pole-winner Andretti
on the 28th la and led 2 ofthe last
221 laps, inc udin the ﬁnal 167.

Mansell, who nished third to
Fittipaldi in May in his ﬁrst India»
napolis 500, had more problems
with the rou h track and the heat
on Sunday t an he did with any
other driver in the 23-car field.

“The circuit is just fantastic,“ he
said. “It stands alone, just like Indi-
anapolis. I’ve never dnven anything
like it in m life and it’s beaten me.

Dr Alvin R. Feinstein. Pro

Jessor of Medicine and Epi-
c't-ntiolngv at Yale University.
says that if his ﬁndings of
more than 1.300 lung cancer
patients are conﬁrmed for the

The team also found that
the " Pap smear search rate "
was substantially higher for
patients with a chronic or re-
cent. respectively)‘ than for
patients with no cough (59
per cent). But within each
category of cough the " search
rates went up in relation to
the amount of smoking."

Among patients with no
cough the search rate rose
from 46 per cent in the no-

his driving suit soaked by perspi-

straight Port- ﬂ
land pole.

The defending PPG Cup
chain ion did break the track
record with a lap of
116. 651 mph, but Unser’s Pfast
lap of 116. 861, coming in the ﬁ~
nal 60 seconds of the 30~minute
session, gave him his second
pole of the season and ﬁfth of his
career.

“I wrung it's neck out there,”
Mansell said of his Ford Cos-
worth-powered Lola. “I proba-

It was the best we could do and
I’m just 'glad we were able to

“But, give the Penslce team

Mansell has yet to win his ﬁrst
race this season while watching
the Penske trio of Unser, former
track record-holder Emerson Fit-
tipaldi and Paul Tracy win ﬁve

of six, including the last ﬁve in a
row.

 

A Nigel Mansell pulls a mask
over his head as he prepares
for qualiﬁcations for today’s

track record and had the pole

position until Al Unser, Jr.
snatched it away in the ﬁnal
minute of Saturday’s qualifying.

Now the Englishman ﬁnds
himself surrounded by Marlboro
red and White with Unser along-

WASHINGTON. May lS—Carmine
DeSapio. boss of Tammany Hall a gen-
eration ago, abolished the smoke-
filled room 'during his tenure as leader
because his eyes were sensitive to
smoke.

In that sense at least. Mr. DeSapio
b regarded as a prophet without honor
new organization. one fiercer and
more self-righteous than the old Tiger
of Tammany: the Group Against Smok-
ers' Pollution (GASP).

Across the nation. GASP chapters
have been formed to help shame the
52 million American smokers into re-
the "breathing space“ of nonsmokers.

'Nonsmokers have rights too” is
the slogan of GAS? and in its “liberr
about methods to discomfit those who
discomfort them. Some ideas are
forthright—"Speak out against smok-
lng!"—while others are maddening.
such as "Discourage smoking by not
providing ashtrays.”

So far. so good: In an enclosed
space. people who are annoyed by
tobacco smoke should make known
their irritation to smokers. who should
then have the courtesy to desist. Un-
fortunately. that is not the last GASP:
Buoyed by their success in getting air-
lines to segregate smokers. the non‘
smokers are pressing their attack with
demands for government regulatior. of
"breathing space."

posal to compel the segregation o.‘
smokers from nonsmokers in most
public places. including restaurants.
This is a good example of the tyr.
army of the minority. A little group
opinion but their own. has rendered
the great smoking public helpless and
contemptible.

'Where a fire or health hazard exists.
nobody disputes that smoking should

 

be prohibited. But despite the fuming’

of former Surgeon General Jesse
Steinfeld. no evidence exists to sug-
gest that the exhaled smoke of other
persons poses a health hazard to non-
to be oonstdered. but public policy
ought not to be set to accommodate
today's Carmine DcSapios.

The cigarette smoker is already the
target of too many Government agen-
cies. He cannot be advertised to on
television: he must carry around on
ing himself: he is taxed regressively
and punitively.

Yet the smoker continues to smoke;
in the United States last year. 588
billion cigarettes were puffed, dragged
upon and choked over, and thanks to
the growing interest in smoking by
teen-age girls. the market continues

FRANCE: CAN THE EVEN BILL ON TOBACCO BE APPLIED?

 

La Tribune Desfosses, 12 Jul 1995, p.29:—

CNCE,< a French association in charge of
making sure that the Evin bill on limiting
advertisement on tobacco and alcoholic products
is enforced properly, >is being involved in a
number of legal issues with tobacco makers in
France.

This is because the tobacco manufacturers are
bypassing the Evin bill. which proves to be
difficult to enforce.

In addition to contesting a number of
statements of the bill, like arguing that it is
a hindrance to personal freedom, the tobacco
makers keep presenting scientific surveys which
ten& to prove that tobacco cannot damage health.

CNCT also Eights this. arguing that the
studies are biased owing to the fact that the
tobacco makers finance them. The association
denounced recently a study by JeanrJacques Rosa
of IEP<, the French institute of political
studies>, which showed that tobacco was more
profitable than damageable to the community.
The study was financed by CDIT, the French
entity which supplies information and
documentation on tobacco>.

quickly recovered and got back into the

"I wasn't planning on passing him,

Saturday’s final qualiUing, the common

Miss the setup?Does this leave you
wondering? An engineer earning $500,000
or so peryear and a race driver worth $3
million or more per annum, and together
they can’t make their 930-horsepower,
$750,000 Reynard do what it's supposed to

The consequence of one car working
better than another is tiny, but huger At
Long Beach this April — a street circuit
like Toronto‘s — Paul Tracy qualiﬁed 17th.
The setup was hopeless.

Tracy's qualifying lap was 1.345 l

secon s slower than pole-winner Gil de
Ferran‘sr Imagine the difference of a
s'econd and a bit measured over 1.968
miles. Tracywas despondent. Both he and
de Ferrari were driving Honda-powered
Reynards with Firestone tires. His best
effortcouldn’t compensate for the fact his
car‘s setup wasn’t spot on

Itwas Tracy who once uttered one of the
more memorable descriptions of an ill-
handling Penske car, following qualifying
for a Molson Indy several years ago.

“Thinkorfa shoiming cart with one ofthe
feels"

Tracy is now more circumspect. More
experienced, too. in Long Beach, he un-
derstood his car likely would be more com-
petitive in race trim. The Team Kool Green
engineers decided in desperation to
change Tracy‘s car to the setup Greg
Moore had used in Long Beach in 1999.
Steve Challis, Moore’s long-time engineer,
had brought the pertinent notes will) him
to TKG. Tracy went on to win the race.

"This new R ard, at least for me, is a
knifeedge kin of car," Tracy reﬂected
when asked why the pursuit of a workable
setup is proving so much more difficult
than in 1999.

“It’s either at a bunch of understeer or
it’s got a bunc of oversteerr Andi haven’t
been able to ﬁnd middle groundyet.”

Oversteer reiers to the car wanting to
pivot, with the tail leading the nose, Acar
with overstecr is said to be loose. An
understeering car, on the other hand, is
but the car doesn’t turn in equal measure,
its nose pushes toward the wall.

car — and he can achieve that in this car,

‘ whereas I can’t deal with massive under-
steer," Tracy continued.

The 2000 Reynard is an evolutionary
' design, closely related to earlier Reynards.
But two changes account largely for the
CART mandated a smaller under-wing to
, prevent speeds from risingbeyond mutant
levels, by lessening downforce. Second,
of CART by creating harder tires that are
longer lasting and safer, but oiier less grip.

‘llatural lalent’

Morris Nunn may he the most celebrat-
ed engineer within CART. Although he
formed his own team this year, he worked
5 with Alex Zanar‘di and Juan Montoya as
the Target/Chip Ganassi drivers won the
[our past championships in a row.

And yet Nunn points to the driver as a
i After all, Zanardl was sensational at
previous two years He qua ed second,
sixth and second here. And yet Montoya
was an unhap camper here, qualifying
eighth and ﬁnis ing 22nd after contact

“We have to believe that if a uy like
Juan is not competitive, then it’s e oar,"
said Nunn. “But a driver has to help (in
with Juan that he is not a technical guy,
, he just has a natural talent"

Nunn cannot remember as a certainty,
but he suspects the problem in Toronto
was Firestone supplying a newly-
developed tire. His setup that had been
successful in earlieryears did notwork as
well with the new tires‘ diﬁ'erent level of
grip. Now Nunn needed to develop a new
setup on the basis ofwhat the Colombian
prodigy reported

“The feedback h-om Juan was not as
gooda the [setback from Zanardl, or from
Bryan Cl-Ierta, ﬁlling in for the injured Tony

 

l

 

Kanaan). Juan would say to me, many
times, ‘Just get it somewhere near and I’ll
do the rest.‘

“He'dget out of the car and say, ‘OK, it‘s
close enough,” or, ‘Oh, the car is s— ’Wliich
doesn’t tellyou anything So it is diEcult (to
take steps to make the carworkhetter),"

Nunn, in contrast to Tracy, views the
Reynard’s tendency to understeer as a
constant over the past ﬁve years Yet, high»
lighting the different behaviour patterns
perceived by different drivers, Nunn
became convinced early this year that
somehow the push was gone.

"With Alex, Jimmy (Vassar) and Juan,
these cars always had understeer.” Nunn
explained “That‘s what we were improving
all the time, that’s what was controlling
entry and mid-corner speed.
“Now I have my own team and a new
driver, Tony Kanaan, and when Tony got
in this car, he said, ‘There‘s no understeer
whatsoever. The car gum everywhere I
want it to go.”

"You wonder, how did they achieve that
with Lhe same uprights and suspension
geometry, nothing changed in fact I called
Alex and said he’dbe amazed, this car has
no understeer.

More grlp
“But we go to Portland last month and
Bryan, ﬁlling in for Tony, gem out of the
car and so s, ‘Understeerl You turn the
wheel. the nt end washes out”

This sort of confusion delights Noni-i1
because he can ﬁgure it ouL And it demon-
strates bow ﬁnding the perfect s‘etup
depends on understan ' your driven

Tony Kanaan is a late raker, braldng

not only as he approaches a. turn, but as'

he beg ins turni the steering wheel. The
weight transfer m the braking affords
effectively.

Qualifying setup and race setup, of
course, are mummy diﬂ‘erent. In qualify-
ing the driver storms the track, in Tracy’s

1 words pushing to 110%, because the only
goal IS the fastest single lap.

"Team Kool Green certainly hasn’t done

a real good job wiﬂi the qualifying setups,
we‘ve done good with llie race setups,” said
team owner Barry Green.
i "We want the car basically m qualifying
I to go as fast as we possibly can. We want
‘ the driver to be very comfortable over the
race distance. There’s a big difference.”

A year ago, Tracy and engineer Tony
Cicale, who rejoined the team mid-season,
were considered the epitome of success-
ful chemistry betwixt driver and engineer.
Tracy invariably qualiﬁed among the top
ﬁve — after having struggled through 1993
to break into the mp 104

downiorce, they’re still a formidable part-

. asked about the dili‘iculty. “A driver might

“His lap time might be deﬁcient because

important to understand not only what the

will we go iaster'.” 01', ‘If we make the
rectum better, willwe go faster?’

“So it’s quite important that the driver

that and determines, ‘Will that affect my

0f Smoking, Lack of Niacin and Cancer

 

Etoﬂ' Reporter o] 'l'siti WALL S'ritttirr Jonas!“-

SAN FRANCISCO—The smoldering contro-
versy over whether there is a connection be-

tween cigaret smoking and lung cancer is be-
ing stoked snow by cancer research scien-
tists. And. all in all. it's proving to be a bad
time for mice and a confusing time for
smokers. -

It San Francisco pharrnacologist threw a
new fagot in the fire at a weekend press con-
lease until yesterday afternoon.

Dr. B. l... Freedlander of Mount Zion Hos-
pital and Medical Center said he has found
a relationshipnin mtce— between the lack of an
important vitamin and cancer. He now has an
experiment underway to find out if this may
be tied in with a substance sound in tobacco.

Dr. Freedlsnder's announcement comes on
top of a disclosure a few days earlier by set-
enttsts at New York University that they had
proved that tobacco tar "unquestionably" con-
tains a cancer-causing substance. However. ef-
forts to prove that it can cause lung cancer
have met with failure.

Till“! Belemtlsl's Tests

working with mice. suggests that giving up
smoking to stave off lung cancer may increase
a person's chances of getting some other type
of cancer.

Dr. Freedlander. as had the other acien~
lists. disclosed the details of his experiments
on mice to a group of newsmen now touring
the nation's cancer research centers under the
So far. the only evidence that smoking has
a connection with lung cancer are statistical
studies made of groups of smokers and non-
smokers. The studies show that smokers have
a higher incidence of lung cancer than non-
smokers and that groups of heavy smokers
have a higher incidence of lung cancer than
average or light smokers. Since the studies
were released in lost. researchers have been
striving to find laboratory proof that smoking
can cause lung cancer. The proof. say the re-
searchers. has not yet been found.

Spokesman for the tobacco :n‘uelrv have
not establish a cause and ettcct relationship.
they also note that niaiw other possibly can-
cer-i'nusing compounds are i-ihelnrl, particu-
larly in cities.

Experiment With Niacin

in his experiment. Dr. Freedlander said that
have been feeding a group of mice a diet de-
ficient in Niacin. one of the B vitamins.
Another group of mice was given a normal
diet. The mice were bred especially to be
susceptible to a type of lung cancer—a type
not found in humans—and both groups were
given a dose of cancer-causing chemicals to in-
sure that they developed cancers.

The mice on the niacin deficient diet devel-
lander said. The mice on the normal diet
developed only it per mouso. strong evidence
that a lack of niacin increases the straceptt-

bllity to cancer. he explained.

The two are now carrying their experiment
further to check any connection with smoking.
They have found a substance in tobacco which
is chemically simuar to niacin. This substance.
called B-AP. can be converted to useftil niacin
in the liver. Dr. Freedlander explained. But.
he theorizes. if a—AP is inhaled it apparently
by-pssses the liver and is loose in the body as
a false vitamin which living cells may confuse
with the true vitamin.

Does the s-AP sneak into a cell posing as a
vitamin and then sabotage the cell causing
cancer? Dr. Freedlander says he has still on-
other experiment under way to find out.

Test With Vapor

He is giving the a-AP in vapor form—not
smoke-Jar the mice to hihale to see if this
increases the number of lung cancers in the
rodents.

"We haven't proved anything yet." he cau-
tions. "There may be no relation between mice
he adds. "it may be just a coincidence that it
is a lung cancer the mice develop."
New-amen. many of them smoking. re-
peatedly asked the scientist if this meant it
the hope it would effect the effects of 3-AP
Jump to any such conclusion. emphasizing his
experiments were on mice and had proved
nothing yet except that mice who do not get


enough niacin are more susceptible to lung
cancer.

The reason for using mice. he explains. is
a compound could be carclogenic (cancer

causing).
A New York University scientist. Dr. Nor-

ton Nelson. iold the newsmen that "unques-
tionably there is something carciogenic in to-
bacco tar. though it is very weak." He bases
his conclusion on experiments where the skins
of mice were painted with. heavy doses of
tobacco tar over a long period of time. They

developed skin cancer.
He and another N.Y.U. scientist note, how-

ever. that after a year of using a new method
failed to produce any lung tumors with tobacco
tar.

Researchers Frustrated

The fact that they have not been able to
cause cancer wi-h tobacco tar anywhere except
on the skin of a mouse has frustrated many of
the researchers. 0n the smoking question
however. Dr. Irena Koprowska. a pathologist
at the Habnemann Medical College and Hospi-
tal in Philadelphia. told the newsmen a few
cervix in mice with tobacco tar. To do so. she
had to Epply the tar to mice five "me- a week
over a period of to months. This still leaves
unanswered the question of whether tar will
cause cancer lit the lung.

H. J. Figge. has come up with another strange
hypothesis about smoking and lung cancer. He
has been working on several experiments on
the susceptibimy of mice to cancer. including
cross-breeding of several different mice strains
to check a theory that obesity increases sus-
ceptibility to liver cancer.

In one experiment. Dr. Flgge says he found
that when he suppressed the susceptibility to
breast cancer the mice became more suscep-
tible to leukemia. His conclusion:

"We do not know enough about the variation
in cancer-susceptibility of human subjects to
advise them to give up smoking in the attempt
to decrease the incidence of lung cancer. for
we do not know for sure that giving up smoking
may not stimulate factors associated with sus-
ceptibility to other forms of cancer." He adds.
with a grin at smoking newsmen. "if I smoked.
i wouldn't give it up now."

California Could collect more than $1 billion

’vThe San Francisco Democrat has been pushing a
« esolution to that effect, but with little success. First,

'Qans on the Rules Committee killed it.

the state budget,” he said. “It‘s not a stupid off the-‘
wall idea. ”
At least five states have already filed such lawsuits,
and several more are expected to do so shortly. The
Liggett Group, the smallest of the top five cigarette
makers, stunned the industry last month when it said

' ‘ it would settle claims filed by Florida, Massachusetts,‘

Mississippi Louisiana and West Virginia. 7'

Despite the potential gain to the state, Assembly
Republicans felt that the decision on whether to sue
was best left to the attorney general, said Wendy
Weber, a spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Curt-
Pn’ngle, R~Garden Grove.

Lungren spokesman Steve Telliano said the at-
torney general hadn’t decided Whether or not to ﬁle a
lawsuit, and hadn’t taken a position on Burton’s pro-
posal. "Were monitoring what's being ﬁled in the

A quick and easy way of di-
agnosing a number of diseases,
including some cases at unde-
tected lung cancer. has been
developed at the Johns Hopv

icine in Baltimore.
The test can be pedal-med

runs a small metal wheel over
prescribed areas at the pat

The wheel is an electrode.

meter records the resistance
encountered by the llow at

maps the pattern on a draw-

"Almost everything that hap-

The Legislature can no doubt find that tobacco
smoke is disturbing to the comfort and desired
environment of nonsmokers. but to declare it harmful
to the health of nonsmokers contradicts medical facts

A non-smoker cannot contract cancer or other
disease from second-hand smoke. .

Before further addresing the question of disease.
it is necessary to dispel several misconceptions about
sidestream tobacco smoke.

Firstly. because it is diluted by the environment. it

variables such as smoke concentration, room volume.

Another misconception is that the exposure of a
aonamoker can be measured in terms of a specific
number of cigarettes Although misleading. the
concept of using a given number of cigarettes is
understandable. especially for lay persons and non-
hedical journalists

However, such an extrapolation involves highly
unreliable estimates and is usually based upon
unrealistic experiments

A delegate asked Dr. Hammon his views on the

“Dr. Hammon stated that‘tbere was ‘no shred of
evidence that a nonsmoker an get cancer from

Dr. Johnathan Rboada. chairman of the National
Canon Advisory Board and a past-president of the

American Cancer Society. is another presti‘gibua
spokesman for the anti-smoking movement. He
declared;

“i do not have hard evidence in that direction fthat‘
there is a harmful effect from smoke on the non-
smokerl. To my. knowledge. it is not. in fact. actually

The “Journal of Preventive Medicine" reported to
its professional readership;

Foundation; is one of‘ the ma )or scientific voices of the
anti-smoking movement. He sums it up this way
. “Passive smoking can provide tears or can be

California's legislators face a political decision
concerning what some non-smokers find disagreeable
or annoying.
To proclaim such a law necessary to protect the
health of nonsmokers is a premise contradicted by
scientific evidence. The opinion of researchers does not
provide a sound scientific basis upon which the

Fewer women aged
13-44 are smoking,

THE. ASSOCIATED PRESS

CHICAGO — T he smoking rate r
itrg age declined signiﬁcantly dur-
ing a recent 10-year period. a
newly reported phone survey indi-
cams.

Researchers [min the federal :
Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention reported that the per-
centage ol’ women of childbearing
age who had ever smoked declined
to 33.2 percent in 1995 from 4-1.1
percent in 1.987. Additionally, 31c
phi-valence of current smu ing e-
nrined to 11.8 percent in 1 from
ltij percent in 1987.

The results of the telephone sur-
vey of 187,302 women aged 18 to
44 from 33 states appear in today’s
lSSlIE of the Journal of the Ameri-
can Me it: some on.

The researchers, led by Dr. Sha-
ltul Ehral'u'm. said women who to
about half as likely to be current
smokers as women who weren't
pregnant — airdljo that ﬂuctuated
only slightly over the 10-year sur-
vey period.

ln1987, 16.7 percent or the preg-

ers and 26.7 percent of the women ‘


smoked. By 1996, only 11.8 percent
of the pregnant women smoked

and only 23.6 of women who

weren't pregnant did.

"in this analysis, the decline in
smelting over time among pregnant
women was primarily due to the
overall decline in smoking initia-
tiorr.rates among women of child-
bearing age, not to an increased
rate ul'srndking cessition related to
pmgnnncy," the researchers wrote.
The researchers cautioned that
because the survey had excluded

not live in private residences. they
may have underestimated [hc actu-

State of Immtmity
And Personality

Tied to Cancer

Medical Tribune Report
disease has recently been sharpened to an
extent that enables a delineation of the
“cancer—prone personality.”
And what ultimately makes him sus-
ceptible to cancer may be a psychologi-
cally triggered alteration in his immune
defense.

Both views, and some supporting ex-
periments, were reported here at the 13th
anndal Science Writers Seminar of the
American Cancer Society.

The personality sketch was described by
Claus Bahnson, Ph.D., senior research
scientist at the Eastern Pennsylvania Psy-
chiatric Institute in‘Philadelphia, who for
more than 10 years has been testing and
interviewing hundreds of cancer patients
for comparison with normal persons and,
more recently, with coronary patients and

patients with a variety of other somatic
diseases.

In general, be said, the cancer patient
represses all unpleasant “affect states,”
such as anxiety, depression, hostility, or
guilt, much more effectively than. nor-
mals or other sick persons do. As might
cent stress of any kind, or psychic
anxiety and is furthest from the “pat-
tern A” associated with myocardial in-
farction (competitive, restless, anxiety-
laden).

From childhood the typical cancer pa-
tient recalls a life that was “bleak and un-
satisfying,” remembering mother as un-
loving and u’nprotecting and father as un-
protecting and undemanding. The upshot
is a person who conforms to social norms,
living “a formal, realistic, and common-
sense—oriented effective social and family
life unrelated to his basic needs for affec-
tion, warmth, and personal creativity.”

“The cancer patient is a nice guy,” Dr.
Bahnson said, and has great difﬁculty deal-
ing with or expressing anger.
Subjected to statistical analysis, the
compared with normals and patients with
other ills indicated the cancer patients’ re-
pression of emotions was signiﬁcantly
greater than that of any other patient in all
indices except guilt, where there was no
meaningful difference between cancer,
coronary, and other sick patients.

Dr. Bahnson said he currently is work—
ing with cancer specialists and immunolo-
gists in an effort to pin down a relationship
between affect and stress states and im-
mune reactions in cancer patients com-
said, on a purely empiric basis it should be
possible to screen psychologically a ran-
dom group of people and accomplish a 30
per cent improvement in forecasting
which members of the group are most

Philip Morris
Plans an Attack
On EPA Report

By EBEN SHAPIRO
The new management team at Philip
Morris Cos is going on the attack. .
The company s two top executives told
Wall Street analysts in New York last night

. that Philip Morris plans to unleash a

barrage of newspaper advertisements crit-
ical of media coverage of the secondhand

, smoke issue. The advertisements repro-.

duce parts of an article from Forbes
gMediaCritic magazine attacking media

coverage of the possible hazards posed By
secondhand smoke. They will run as- a
series over five days next week in major
newspapers. including the New Yotk.

Times, the Washington Post and The Wall -

with the slogan “In any controversy, facts
must matter. " l

The nation’s largest tobacco company
has several reasons for the counterattacks.
Competitors have privately criticized the
company for sitting out much of this year’s
chairman, R. William Murray, and presi‘

dent and chief executive officer, Geoffrey ,
C. Bible, are eager to confirm Wall Street
and employee expectations that they will
be feistier combatants than their predeces-
sor, Michael A. Miles who resigned last
week. Mr. Miles, a veteran of the food
industry, was never comfortable jumping
into the tobacco fray.
At a briefing with Mr. Murray and
at the company's Miller Brewing unit
asked several questions about how the
company planned to fight back more
effectively.

that has had a major impact on the indus-
try. RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp, which'is
running an extensive series of ads stress-
ing “accommodation” on smoking' issues,
has already taken aim at the secondhand
smoke report.

The industry has filed suit against the

RJR has since expanded its campaign
beyond secondhand smoke and recently

that bans on caffeine, alcohol and ham-
burgers might be next

The Honolulu City Council is
on the verge of doing the right
thing by banning smoking from
public restaurants in Honolulu.

Council members should not
be swayed by arguments that

a multifaceted disorder involving not
only hyperacidity but hypei'motility,
infection, allergy, and local endarte-

include eradication of any or all of the
above factors in order to satisfac-
torily rectify the disease.

'The Sippy diet was discarded by me
because it not only did not clear all
the symptoms but left the patient
weak and unhappy. With the treat-

The effect of disorders of the ner-

crine disturbances, on skin and hair
are well established but rarely come
to the attention of the dermatologist.
Aside from their diagnostic signiﬁ-

any therapeutic stir.

. It may be for this reason that the

Pentagon Steps Up Effort to Limi

 

Promotion, Sale of Tobacco in Militaryw

 

By Bradley Graham

Wuhmn Post SuHWmer

Stepping up efforts to curb cigarette
smoking among military personnel. the
Pentagon intends to ban such promo-
tional practices as ndlitaryonly discount
coupons and tobamo company pay-
ments to stores for favorable product
placement and will limit the amount of
shelf space reserved for tobacco prod-
um in military outlets.

The Defense Department‘s
nonsmoking drive reflects heightened
discern. Pentagon ofﬁcials say, about
lost productivity and rising health care
Pentagon‘s initiative has generated
sparks over the past year with a House
defense subcommittee. many of whose
members have received campaign done
lions from the tobacco industry.

A decision last summer to raise the
price of cigarettes sold in military com-
misearies led to heated congressional
charges diat the Pentagon had failed to
consult suﬁ‘iciently with legislators and

required cornmissaries to sell products
at m‘the lowest practical price." One
tobacco-state lawmaker. Rep. C. Saxby
Chamblisa (RGa), warned the Petite.
restrictions on cigarette advertising and
marketing that defense ofﬁcials have
now formally notiﬁed Congress they
plan to put into effect this summer.

Although the latest measures aie not
expected to draw enough congressional
opposition to block them. the smoking
issue generally has placed the Pentagon
in the trying position of balancing con-
service members against the rights of
members to choose whether to smoke.

For years. military life facilitated
smoking. Mess kits contained free ciga-
rette packs Tobacco ﬁrms would send
cigarettes to combat zones as a patriotic
gesture, a practice stopped during the
1991 Persian Gulf War. Training drills
allowed for periodic smoke breaks. Car-
tons could be purchased in military
commissaries for discounts of up to 76
percent off commercial retail prices.
“A lot of people picked up smoking in
the military.” said John Mazzuchi. a
Pentagon health ofﬁcial who has had a
role in the antismoking effort’s slow
evolution. "We had to create a new

educational environment a new culture
smoking is not cool. it's not good for you
and it‘s bad for overall readiness of the
force."

Defense Department attempts to cur-
tail smelting began in the mid-19805,
although the campaign was limited then
By the early 1990s, a governmentwide
effort to ban smolo’ng in federal areas
nated smoking areas on military bases.

But raising commissary prices was a

much more sensitive proposition. be
cause the discounts available in these
govenunentsubsidized military super-
markets are highly valued by service
tant to single out any product as an
exception. Besides, tobacco products
were big business for commissaries,
generating $747 million in revenue and
$103 million in proﬁts and surcharge
revenue in 1995.

What ﬁnally prompted the Pentagon
related productivity losses and medical
care. estimated at $930 million in 1995.

“We were actually asking the Ameri-
can taxpayer to subsidize a product that
which there were substantial costs,”
said Fred Pang. the Pentagon's assistant
secretary for force management.

Cigarettes are still sold in the mili
tary's 230 conunissaries, but responsi-
bility for managing the sales now rests
with the military exchanges, which are
not subsidized and so charge more.
Even so. tobacco prices in these military
outlets remain below commercial retail
levels—a fact that defense ofﬁcials ap
pear resigned to accept rather than
court more political attack

"We considered raising prices to pre
tailing market rates. and we concluded
that at least for now. the pricing policy
we have is defensible.” said Pang, “We
have not rejected absolutely that we
would not do something like raise prices
farther. That is under review now.”
A report by the Pentagon s inspector
general issued in December, urged that
prices be lifted to commercial retail
levels. "lhe Department of Defense 15
sendingamixedmessag etoitsbeneﬁ
ciary population." it said “DOD should
not encourage tobacco sales through
discounted prices when the DOD health

community is striving to reduce the
effects of tobacco on the acﬁveduty
force and its beneﬁciary population."

In a move that defense ofﬁcials see as
authorization bill shifting responsibility
for overseeing the military stores from
Pang's force management ofﬁce to the
comptroller.

Rep. John M. McHugh (R»N.Y.).
chairman of the House National Securi-
ty Committee's panel on morale. welfare
and recreation (MWR), said in an inter-
view that the measure had nothing to do
with getting even. “It simply was an
attempt to respond better to MWR
programs. whose major crises are all
financially related." the congressman
stressed.

But the Pentagon is convinced re-
venge played a part in the panel‘s
attempt to eliminate the job held by
Stephen Rossetti Jr. a former Demo-
cratic staff member on the House sub-
committee who was hired by Pang to
revamp the military stores and impie
merit the new cigarette policy.

’l'he panel's action clearly was at
least somewhat retaliatory,” said Pang.
'lhe comptroller could certainly do the
job, but the military stores are regarded
by service members as a beneﬁt. a very
valued beneﬁt. and all the beneﬁt pro
posed change would be an added re
sponsibility for the comptroller that
doesn’t make any sense."

In a letter to McHugh last week. Pang

stores Additional meastnes banning

Pangwrote. ‘

The Pentagon‘ s declining tolerance
for smoking has resulted in adrop in the
proportion of smokers' in uniform. from
defense ofﬁcials intend to cut the num
ber of active-duty personnel who smoke
to 20 percent.

we have to look for our opportunities”

The committee recommended
that the proposed anti-pollution

The report specifically stated:
"In general. it does not refer to

with this modern problem also
were defined by the committee.

In Courtrooms, the Debate

May Never Be the Same

By MILO GEYeuN
And RICHARD B. SCHMITI‘
Sta/f Reporters of THE WALL STREET J OURNAL

Liggett Group’s tentative settlement of
a giant classaction suit against the to-
bacco industry could alter the dynamics of
tobacco litigation forever.

Plaintiffs would receive only a meager
sum for smoking-cessation programs, but
some legal experts predict the settlement
will set a benchmark for the industry's
legal liability and may help potential ju-
rors get used to the idea that tobacco
companies should pay damages.

Moreover, lawyers for the plaintiffs
anticipate more immediate benefits in the
class-action suit, known as Castano and
brought on behalf of every U.S. smoker
who claims to be addicted. The industry
is set to argue next month before a federal
appeals court in New Orleans that the case
is too big and unmanageable to proceed as
a class action. The Liggett settlement, say
that argument by showing that the issues
can be resolved through negotiations.

“The principal objection is that this
case is so large and complex that it’s not
manageable. This settlement will show
that it not only is manageable but that
we’ve managed it," says Richard Hei-
mann of the San Francisco firm Lieff,
Cabraser & Heimann.

That argument will become even more
Liggett parent Brooke Group Ltd. suc-
ceeds in his bid to merge Liggett with the
nation’s second-largest tobacco company,
the Reynolds Tobacco unit of RJR Nabisco
Corp. If that happens, Mr. LeBow‘s settle-
ment would extend to the combined entity,
which would have a 27% market share.

The 44—page settlement, which requires
court approval, also includes a number of
provisions that could further divide the
tobacco companies and give plaintiffs a leg
up in the fact-finding phase of the litiga~
tion. Chief among them is a provision
requiring Liggett to disclose “any fraudu-
lent or illegal conduct" by any tobacco
company that results in the suppression of
evidence or otherwise is “designed to
frustrate or defeat” plaintiffs.

“We’re not going to see any more of this
stonewalling and hiding documents," said
Russ M. Herman of Herman, Herman,
Katz & Cotlar in New Orleans. “if they‘ve
got them, we‘re going to get them.”

Some people say the plaintiffs lawyers
gave up too much to get those concessions.
Under the settlement’s terms, Mrl LeBow
could cancel the deal and terminate pay
ments at any time if he decides too
many smokers have rejected the terms and
opted out. Mr. LeBow could also walk away
if his former co-defendants score a court-

room victory.

At the very least.- the settlement would
enable Mr. LeBow to slash Liggett‘s $10-
million-a—year bill for defending itself in
tobacco lawsuits. At current profit levels,
Liggett would pay no more than $2 million
a year for 25 years under the settlement.
It “seems like a sweetheart deal" for
Liggett. says Larry Schonbrun, an Oak-
land, Calif., lawyer who is often critical of
class actions.

Some other tobacco litigants also criti-
cize the deal as a giveaway. “The settle-
ment is just an embarrassment." says
Miami plaintiffs lawyer Stanley Rosenb-
against the tobacco industry pending in
Florida. Liggett’s lawyers believe that the
Castano settlement will supersede Mr. Ro-

Still unclear is whether Liggett can
persuade enough states to.join a separate
suits seeking compensation for the cost to
taxpayers of providing health care to

wears no smile and
dark glasses; who

he prefers them to

He likes cigarets and hates: women so
much, in fact, that he forsakes the latter
on deserted highways, ocean liners, cable
cars, mountain tops, penthouse apartments
and anywhere else if the girls as much as

This infuriating oat may yet go down in
marketing history as one of the most bril-
liant creations of adVertising pundits. Ob-
viously, viewers of either sex—and partic-
ularly the young—enjoy vicariously the
adventures of the Silva Thins man.

Women (an important market for this
cigaret): especially dig the scene of “The
Impossible Cigarett” Psychologically, they

hiding behind a- smoke

hypocrisy in its attempt to ban
ciganette advertising and pro-

motion;

It is now obvious Premier Burke's
Labor Government wants the: bene-

cricket matches. but none of: the
carnmenciall overtones.

.He says it Perth was deprived of

This would mean having to endhre

six hours ot‘boundary signs and any
other cigarette promotion that crop-
ped up during the telecast.

Therefore. he reasons. it would be
better to have the game in Perth
where the TV audience would only
have to endure two hours at the
signs ’— the normal tea to stumps

All Lip Service
. . Little Action

 

Several years ago the U. S; Surgeon General made
an announcement about the hazards of cigarette smoké
ing and the connection with cancer. The Medica‘ll'ffo-
fession has linked smoking with cancer and poor health,
and a small‘ TV advertising campaign has been sug-
gesting that cigarettes are a health hazard.

Congress passed weak legislation requiring the fol-
lowing words be printed on every cigarette pack: "Cau—
tion: Cigarette Smoking May Be Hazardous To Your

Now the Public Health Service has released an-
other report on smoking. The release says that a heavy
cigarette smoker may be shortening his life by eight
years if he continues the habit. In addition to calling
the cigarette habit the main cause for lung cancer. the
report said the habit can: contribute to the develop-

This is the first time that the PHS has linked heart
Secretary Wilbur Cohen of the Health. Welfare, and
Education Department suggested to Congress the words
on cigarette packages Should be changed to: “Warning:
Cigarette smoking is dangerous to health and may
cause death from cancer and other causes.”

The FTC went a step further and suggested that
cigarette advertising should be prohibited on television.

It is obvious the big money interests of the Cigar-
ette Industry will prevent any substantial action by the
Congress. The politicians will‘ use the same excuse that
was used here in Massachusetts recently in regard to
billboard advertising.

A bill to curb billboard advertising b'r giving the
towns and cities vé't'o’ power was killed‘ because state
of work. This same weak excuse will undoubtedly be
used in CongreSS in regard to cigarettes . . . despite the

far more important consideration of the health and wel-
fare of the people.
The human being is weak. and the only way cigar-
ette smokers are going to quit the habit is through
some kind of prohibition. All the verbal and written


with the habit know it's unhealthy but haven't the will
The Medical Profession tells people they should
not smoke. and many doctors tell their patients they
should quit smoking..But the hollow words fall on deaf
ears because the medical authorities do not practice
vhat they preach and are really doing little to help
people quit the habit.

If cigarettes are really a health hazard. it is time
that health and medical leaders stopped the "lip serv-
ice" and do something about it, Actioni speaks louder
than words.

You can still buy cigarettes in hospitals,
You can still buy cigarettes in drug stores.

And inmost medical centers and doctor's offices,

" you can stilli smoke in the waiting rooms. And; many

doctors who speak against cigarettes are smokers them-
seIVes.

You can’t buy poisonOUS drugs in drug stores with-
out a prescription. and you certainly can‘t get them in
a hospital. Alli materials that may be iniurious totone 5

“How Big Government and at what

budget, stop spending, no new,

taxes, and spend within it’s means
like all businesses and home owners
must do. We need leaders with an

Kleckner stressed that cutting the

‘, ' Discovery ls Already in Use, With
Promising Results, in Treating
line Widespread Disorder

 


A common dietary substance found in ‘

eggs, meat and fish has surprisingly di-
rect and almost immediate effects on
brain function, scientists at Massachu.
settvs Institute of Technology have found.

Their discovery has already been used,
with promising results, in treating one
widespread and disabling brain disorder.
Research is in progress to see if the com-
mon food substance called choline might
also be‘ useful in other brain conditions,
including depression and the memory de-
nillty.
All of these efforts stem from the dis-
covery a few years ago that choline

in the brain seems to depend on how

' much choline-rich food the individual has
eaten recently. .

“This is very strange," said Dr. Richard
3'. Wurtrnan at an interview in his labora-
tory in Cambridge. Mass, "because it
means that the composition of each meal
will directly affect the synthesis of
chemical signals in the brain." '

For years it had been generally believed
that something called the blood-brain
barrier protected the brain from direct

This, according to Dr. Wurtman, will
mean an amplification of the nerve sig-

by those cells that use «acetylcholine for
the signaling.

The possible effects of this on behavior
are being studied. ,

Surgeon General of the United

States, did not castrate her hus-
band ortry to cripple an Olympic ath-
lete. Had she done so, the press con-

yet another level of liberty, and that
seems not to be worthy of much pub-
lic attention.

That’s a shame, because of all the
wacky animals in the Clinton zoo,

and whatever she says is sure to
split a rib. Her nutty comments

Only last month, the Surgeon Gener-
al earned a rebuke from the zoo mas-
ter-in-chief himself when she rumi-
nated on the virtues of legalizing
drugs. But last week she preached on
the evils of tobacco, and perhaps the
highlight of her sermon was her
deathless insight that “Any form of
tobacco — smoked, chewed, spit or
inhaled — is lethal.”

Samuel Francis, a columnist forThe
Washington Times, is nationally syndi-
caté’d- His column appears here Tues-
day and Friday.

 

That, of course, is simply non-
sense. There are untold millions of
people who smoke, chew or inhale
tobacco and don’t die from it. There
are people who

while and give it
up. There even
are people who

Samuel stairs. For none of
. these people is the
Francis use of tobacco
“lethal” or even

harmful.

The purpose of the press confer-
ence was to arouse a somnolent citi-
forthcoming magnum opus on smok-
Elders was blasting the tobacco
industry, ex-President Jimmy Carter,
whom Dr. Elders dragged forth as an
ornament for her performance,
urged a $2-per-pack tax increase on
cigarettes to help keep “3,000 chil-
dren from trying cigarettes, for the
ﬁrst time each day.” Whenever you
hear the Word “children,” you should
quietly rip the cellophane on your
pack of Chesterﬁelds.

Then Dr. Antonia Novello, Sur-
geon General under President Bush,
unbosomed the bizarre sentiment
that tobacco is “the least regulated
consumer product” in the country.

But it’s already illegal in most
states for minors to buy tobacco prod-
ucts, and smoking is banned inall air-
planes and many airports, restau-
rants, malls and public buildings, on
top of outlawed cigarette advertising
on TV and radio, compulsory warning
labels and taxes that are already pro-
hibitive. For Dr. Novello to pronounce
that tobacco is “the least regulated”
product in the country is — once
again — an outright lie.

The plan is to push for virtual
prohibition of tobacco by the year
2000, and the Coalition on Smoking
or Health, which also bellied up to
the Surgeon General’s pulpit last
week, had the details. The Food and
Drug Administration should ban
the claims that low-tar and low-
nicotine cigarettes are less danger-
ous than the good stuff. The Feder-
al Trade Commission should ban
“Joe Camel” ads that supposedly
entice children to smoke. The
Transportation Department should

less. Congress should impose the
authority to regulate all tobacco
products, and so on.

The irony of this gala unveiling of
yet another therapeutic war to be
waged by the federal leviathan is that
it comes from the same woman who
has just counseled the legalization of

real drugs. Since Dr. Elders’ own son ,

is facing felony drug charges and her
husband owns a house in Little Rock
notorious as the hang-out of a whole-
some collection of youths known as
dealing themselves, it ought to strike
most Americans as just a bit ripe for
this sanctimonious loudmouth to blus-
ter lies and banalities about tobacco
even as she croons the virtues of
legalizing dangerous substances.
But then, the American ruling class
the pursuit of other peoples’ vices,
especially when there’s power to be
had in the chase. If nothing else, Dr.
Elders’ unnoticed press conference
was a pure specimen of what that
class is up to and how it plans to
achieve it — unless the citizens can
tear themselves away from Lorena
Bobbitt and Tonya Harding long
enough to protect what remains of
their freedom.

Y most objective meas-
ures, Dr. Julie A. Swain is.
like her twin sister, a stun-
ning success.

She is the chief of cardiovascular
surgery at the University of Nevada
School of Medicine, a member of a
Food and Drug Administration com-
mittee that evaluates new devices, a
member of an Agency for Health
o'ps medical practice guidelines and
a member of the Defense Depart-
ment's peer-review committee for
quality assurance.

A decade ago, when she was at
Louisiana State University, she was
the first woman to be chief of cardi-
ac surgery at an American medical
school. And, like her sister, she
evokes effusive praise from col-

Bht Dr. Swain is bitter about her
career. She, like her sister, wants to
be the best, and the best, to her, is a
position as chief of cardiology at a
major medical center. something no
woman has yet achieved. "I'm chief
of cardiology at a very small medi-
cal school," she said.

for lack of hard work. Dr. Swain


~typically works from'6130 in the
vorced and has no children, and she
lives and breathes surgery.
And, apparently, it is not for lack
of talent. Dr. Michael DeBakey, the
eminent heart surgeon at Baylor
University in Houston. said she
“meets what I would regard as the
highest requirements."

Dr. Swain "is very industrious and
very devoted to her career and very
able," he added. "I think she has the
ability to succeed at the very top."

But Dr. Swain believes that the top
women. if advancement were just
based on “hard work and how good
you are. it would be wonderful," she
said. Women surgeons say it is much
harder for them to get Jobs, and
when they do get positions as sur-
geons. Dr. Swain added. they find it
hard to get patients. She explained
that surgeons are dependent on re-

“There probably will‘be a woman
President before there is a woman
chief of surgery at a major medical
school," she said.

_Dr. Stephen E. Epstein, chief of
cardiology at the National Heart,
Lung and Blood institute in Bethes-
da, Md, who has worked with Dr.
Swain, said she is an “excellent car-
diac surgeon" and that ”she did a
superb job" at the heart institute._
But he agrees that heart surgery “is
a very hard field to get into as a
woman."

that a hostile climate toward women
had kept Dr. S‘wain and other able
women from the top ranks. There
are few such positions and many
talented surgeons. he said. "Some-
times it's just related to what oppor-
“Lady luck plays a role."

But Dr. Swain said that if she
could live her life over again. she
would probably do interventional
cardiology." she said.
