Subject: Endoloxin in smoke


At the meeting with Ragnar Ftylander on Aug. 24, 1999, we discussed the endotoxin issue. Please
find attached a draft concept on a pilot study to qualitatively and quantitatively ascertain the claimed
endotoxin delivery to cigarette mainstream smoke.

Ragnar has the LAL assay established in his laboratory in a version that allows the distinction of the
has the material available to do the comparison of unwashed and washed samples.

We further discussed the potential bioassay to determine the biological effect of the washing.
Normally, the response to endotoxin inhalation is the accumulation of polymorphonuclear
leukocytes (PMNL) in the bronchoalveolar space‘ We found this effect in the bronchoalveolar
lavage of rats exposed to mainstream smoke at concentrations of 100 ug total particulate matter/l
or higher. Thus, we think the required biological assay would be at hand at lNBIFO/CFtC. The
question to be tested would be whether the washing would shift the threshold for the PMNL influx to
higher smoke concentrations. Thus, we would probably use three smoke concentrations for each
type of cigarette. The inhalation period would be 21 days. With approximately 1500 cigarettes per
cigarettes per type for a full—blown biological analysis.

I appreciate your attached memo on additional ways to eliminate the clutter in NY, but
the issue for me is that these books that Salem is in are still better suited for Camel,
Kamel and Winston than they are for Salem. I have no intention on lowering the voice of
are more non-menthol driven and edgier. Time-Out is still a great magazine for the brand
and so are all the others mentioned below. All the other books mentioned below should
also stay on plan and have more Camel and Kamel impact. By leaving these books I am
only raising Marlboro‘s share of voice. I will be ﬁred or I should quit if New York share
for Camel and Kamel does not grow. I have to have better, more impactt‘ul advertising.

Salem has a great challenge ahead, but the ONLY thing that will work for Salem is
having more impactful creative. Having Mela — Alem on billboards and POS means
nothing along with the ORB which has no equity. To suggest taking the foot off the pedal
for Camel and Winston with strong equities to make room for Mela - Alem and the Orb is
absolutly wrong. New York if anything needs more Camel impact.

stock price has more than tripled in the 19903? AND, is there any documentation
showing how much the value of investment in PM has grown (eg: in The New York

Subject: Marlboro Milds on the Database

Karen,
in order to add “Milds“ to the survey three things will need to occur.

1. The survey template will need to be updated. i am working with the Corporate group on timing for the update but their
initial response was a relatively quick turnaround time.

2. The database will need to be updated to capture the new information. This would only take 24—48 hours to complete. In
regards to setting a default for Marlboro Milds to Menthol. At the present time Suppliers do not handle default logic due to
data quality concerns. All defaults are done on the database, The database however, is not able to handle the default you
are requesting. if you were to default Marlboro to Milds to Menthol on the database then all Marlboro responses would be

Monarch~ JIM eon/Ly Ace-(wing Ltulbare Miles (at gammmu) writ-es Wot- M

. _ 'i real WW9 ,
3. The data entr suppliers would need to update their programs to allow for the new alue on th tar level question. i have
spoken with Ful illment about timing, and due to significant programming requests and issues already on the priority list,
they would prefer to wait until mid-August to bring this issue up to the Suppliers, Thus, we would not recommend changing
the survey until after this point in time.
in regards to your second question concerning the Regular Brand Question. The suppliers are currently set up to capture
any extra information given in the Regular Brand question that pertains to questions 2-5 on the current survey. That is, if
only the Regular Brand question is asked and an Adult Smoker answers Marlboro Lights, then the data entry supplier
captures Marlboro for the brand and populates Lights for the Tar Level. if we split out Lights and Milds then a response of
Marlboro Milds to the Regular Brand Question would be captured as Marlboro for the brand and Milds for the Tar Level.

in the short term, we could request that a response of Miids be captured as a medium. Thi would be a training issue for
the suppliers versus a programming/database issue.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

We are currently putting together the samples you requested of the different
pack sizes, and should be able to get them to you in a few days.

I understand that the visit here by Chip Brumberg went well. He has confirmed
that the CV reduction is due to leaf crop changes, and some minor modifications
tp processing specifications have been agreed. This should settle things

down with respect to DIET processing for JT, although you should not expect
DIET CV‘s to return to earlier levels as long as this plend 4 crop is in use.

I look forward to having you visit us over‘here at some time in the future:

Dear Ruth.

Thanks for the messages. I will be able to meet with you on Thursday and
Friday. What time do you want to start on Thursday ?

Most of the points raised by yourselves on the content of the presentation
will I believe be covered. However, I do not have any ﬁrm information on
sales of product with regard to nicotine deliveries and soluble ammonia
levels etc. If your guys have any data on this issue we can incorporate it
into the presentation.

Graham Smith has just informed me about a proposed meeting on the 29th Sept
to discuss plans for the cocoa/theobromine presentation. Unfortunately I

will be at B&W in Louisville for that date and thus will not be available.

Maybe we can discuss timings etc for this issue when we meet next week.

Don‘t be horrified. When there is too much to do, it is impossible to remember everything. Yesterday,
Karsten Schmidt took the position, prompted by Helmut Fteit, that to meet with the German Minister of
Health with a publication already in hand would be counter productive. This position carried the day.
Therefore, the document will not be published. I think that I can speak for all of the scientists who were

The stores are currently sorted by territory number, followed by Parliament Kings Box
share. All stores on the list have high Potential Indices (>140). A high potential index
indicates that the demographics of the store mirror Parliamen ' pical consumer. The stores
on this list comprise nearly 74% of the total in 4L0, and uld enable us to achieve our 63%

Subject: Coupon Print Quantities

Hi there. I'd like to try to tighten up where we stand with our subsequent coupon (and survey) print
quantities and schedule.

Taking a look at what‘s been printed and delivered to date, we certainly do not need the print as
many coupons as originally planned for the March/April Batch (3).

PM has received the following:

That‘s a total of 3,828, I 09.

3,500 stores were completed in November and December, and 4,000 stores are planned for January,
l'm assuming 6,833 stores for February. With that volume of stores, I estimate that a total of 2,364,945
coupons would be needed (165 coupons per store). That would leave an overage of 1,463,164
coupons.

Assuming again that we onld do 6,833 stores in both March and April, we‘d need an additional
791,726 coupons printed to cover all stores.

We put together a spreadsheet that may make this a little easier. What i will need from FM is a
conﬁrmation/estimate of the number of stores you will cover per month. Obviously, that will
ultimately drive the print quantities.

if we are in agreement that Batch 3 should be around 800M, that quantity should be delivered by
2/15/01 which means we'd be going to press week after next. Let‘s try to confirm this early next

week.

Thanks!

projects arise that would throw us over budget, we will need to request more funds. Similarly, if we
see that the projects are running under budget, we will have to reassess our needs and should
reallocate any unused funds to other line items or projects.

Joe-

Per our conversation regarding old wholesale account # 53710 ( Box Wholesale)
being purchased by Discount Distributors, and the new KA# 59067 matching with
new customer number. ?

The account has been ordering product from CS as usual, however they have
been ordering under old# 53710. Richmond CS currently has #53710 as
Discount Distributors customer #. This is a huge problem for the account
receiving credit for purchases when their Midas KA# is 59067.

I spoke with Bobby Sherrill Accts. Receivable Supervisor] Richmond CS, and
they arecurrently receiving Discount Dist. #2 orders under #53710 ( sold to ,
ship to) and Paying the bills is #39915 ( bill to, payer) Discount Distributors
parent company.

We need an interface built in to get the exchange for credit of purchases from
53710 to 59067 .....

STARS is receiving the tapes with the correct KA#.. purchases.

Help .....

i would love to pick your brain on how you see us being able to bring some of the process thinking here. i know there
has been some hesitancy on DAve's part to bring Hammer in to talk at senior team level-what do you think about at
the OBT level or the next level down??

I hope we can find some time to discuss.
Look forward to hearing back from you-Dan

Thanks to you both for your input. Dick, the information on Labstat is excellent and l have included the data as a Table.
Are you all OK with the use of the words "ilavorant" and "processing aids.” What about "formulation aids"?

Enclosed is the next draft.

Two portions are highlighted, both of which could be removed. Regarding the second portion (talking about rate of
absorption): this comes from our answer to Markey, with references, plus a direct response to the Pankow claims.
Aerosols are not mentioned; vapor phase is. The inclusion of a discussion about rate is necessary only it the audience
receiving this is sophisticated enough to understand the issues. Certainly, we do not want to provide a complex answer
which confuses folks, when a simply one would work.

Attached are some proposed talking points relating to Thailand that could be used to supplement the
distills thinking from Mark and Betty.

We would not suggest getting into how our cigarette brand names might be present In the Thai
market. Any such discussion would need to take into account point-of—sale, including dispensers, etc,
that brand images that are not identiﬁed by brand name but are closely associated with the brand
(m. a “Marlboro Country'-like Western scene). cannot be found in Thailand,

Please feel free to make any comments or suggestions.

Jeanne,

I have enclosed the ﬁnal version of the Chain Volume Request We have
labeled this as request number B1060. It was produced from the MCP SAS

There were some changes made to the request.

* We changed the completeness store count to include active and completeness
checks for 65 out of 65 weeks. This is just a store count and does not have
an impact on the volume reported.
excluded from the report.

* The total store counts for 1997 and 1998 are calculated based on the
current deﬁnition of the stores within a chain. This means that the

stores associated with the chain in the current time period will be the same
stores checked on the 1997 history. We do not keep old assignments of

retail ids to a particular chain. Therefore there would not be a difference
between the counts. We created one column with the total STARS stores and
another based on the Retail Masters stores.

* The CPW values are based on the average per chain within a week, We
pulled the data from LINQ and collapsed it by chain. Then that value was
divided by the total number of retail ids within the chain.

If you have any questions, just let me know.

Sandy

Enclosed you will ﬁnd an ingredient disclosure that has been prepared for brands sold in the UK.
By way of background the UK. House of Commons Health Committee requested ingredient information from PME late last
week They requested this information by February 28th i am told that the other UK. companies are prepared to respond
and will be providing some form of disclosure by this date.

The proposal is to have our list forwarded by David Davies to the UK. Department of Health and the UK. House of
Commons Health Committee. (Note: this disclosure is similarto the disclosure made to the UK. Department of Health in
November of last year except for the fact that the earlier disclosure coded (and did not identify) brand names. The House

of Commons speciﬁcally requested uncoded information.)

There are also outstanding requests in ireland and Australia, The disclosure format that would be used in Australia and in
all likelihood lreland would include a company list of flavors and a company list of non-tobacco materials,

Please let me know if you would like to discuss the approach being proposed in greater detail.

Leslie,

The ﬁve attached abstracts are respectiully submitted for the TSRG Editorial Committee‘s consideration.

The ﬁfth abstract may, or may not, be appropriate for inclusion within the conference program. As we have discussed,
the authors of

these papers would like to use the iirst four time slots for presentation only, followed by a panel discussion with the
conierence

attendees. It is possible that there will be very iew questions from the ﬂoor (it recent conference history is an indication
of
what to expect), but perhaps such a format will stimulate discussion.

As you will recall, the annual repo1t will feature two large pack photos

case, one "core brand" and one "new and innovative" brand). RJ RT
has selected Camel Lights and Red Kamel; RJRI has selected Camel
Lights (blue pack) and Salem Pianissimo.

The RJ RN staff just wants us be aware that this means 3 out of the 4
large shots are Camels of some sort -- in case this bothers anybody.

Cambridge, MA -- Although the health department wants to pursue a

complete ban on smoking, they‘re apparently willing to listen to arguments from
restaurant owners and allowing some exceptions. Also, at least three city
council members (two plus the mayor) have agreed to rescind the city's
ordinances on smoking to make way for whatever the health department
health department enact a smoking ban. The public health commissioner

feels an agreement will be reached between the restaurants and the health
department. However, no matter what that agreement is this time, he thinks
the town will ban smoking in restaurants and bars in the very near future.

To help defeat the self-service display proposal also before the board,

Bob Stone requests a mailing to retailers to encourage written comments to

the city council and the board.

Solano County, Calif. -- On 8/4, the supervisors will consider a plan to
ban smoking outside the entraces of county building.

Subject: Superslims US patent case - it's over

I'm pleased to report that the B&W patent infringement suit re Virginia Slims Superslims is finally over in the US. PM USA
has won.
in particular, last fall PM USA was successful at the Federal Circuit in arguing that the relevant claims of B&W's US
Reissue Patent 32,615 re a cigarette w/ a reduced circumference were invalid, which upheld a '99 ruling to the same effect
by federal district court in Louisville in a trial beginning in '89. B&W attempted to have a rehearing at the Federal Circuit
and was denied. The time has now passed for B&W‘s last recourse, a petition to the Supreme Court, without anytiling by
them.

He specifics, this clears the way for future PM USA production of Superslims for export, assuming no relevant BAT patents
in the particular countries of destination. We are currently researching the issue specifically in Japan to see if there are
other BAT patents in addition to the BAT Japanese patent successfully invalidated by JT with PM assistance and will
report the results when available in ~3—6 weeks. Of course, our proposed global resolution to BAT in response to their
offer to settle the issue in Australia would resolve this question on a worldwide basis,

Special recognition needs to be made of Jim Schardt, who handled this entire matter for many years with great skill,
patience, and foresight.

We'll keep you posted. Pls. let me know if you have any questions. thanks

This documents a revision we need to make asap to the decision rules for determining

Doral’s ceiling has been increased to $3.00 in 9 regions, effective June 1. Attached is a
copy of the memo from Cliff to Andy detailing the change. I’ve summarized it for our
purposes below.
' 1n 9 regions, increase the Doral ceiling to $0.30/$3.00 in all outlets. These regions are
MWSA, Northern and Southern California. and Seattle.

' For all remaining regions, keep the ceiling as is. That is $0.20/$2.00 in all outlets
except CO‘s, where the ceiling is $0.30/$3.00.

possible to rerun the back data to make this effective for the ﬁrst two weeks in June in

Joyce - We are conducting a feasibility study to develop speciﬁcations for mentholated foil. Here is the objective:
0 Develop menthol on foil Speciﬁcations ((30 Test: mg/150 mm) for all of the PM Material Codes for the seven base

(19# Silver - 51.8 g/mz), (25# Gold - 61.6 glmz). & (30# Silver - 68.4 g/m2)] by conducting process capability analysis
using the Cpk 1.5 methodology approach developed by The Speciﬁcation Development Team in 1998.

. Develop menthol on foil speciﬁcation limits by the methodology speciﬁed above, and verify that the cigarette
subjectives and analyticals (menthol delivery) at these speciﬁcation limits are acceptable.
Now, we have to know if we should develop specs for menthol application on color foils.
Please ﬁll me in.

CLUI-NAPOCA. Romania - Summary:
U.S. government helps companies sell cigarettes to Romanians
There is a conviction that it is Western, glamorous and American to
smoke. Meanwhile, the life expectancy of Romanians -- already one of the
shortest in Europe -- is decreasing.

Nearly two years ago in this paper I reported on the advertizing blitzes
and media campaigns of American cigarette companies here (“Welcome to
Marlboro Country: the new Transylvania", Ian. 25. 1996.)

Interest was expressed by a number of readers. including Sens. Gordon
Smith and Ron ﬂydgn . I suppose I naively hoped sortie congressional action
would result, cutting back government support for the tobacco industry
decrease smoking. especially among youth?

Whatever Congress or the White House may or may not have done, our
tobacco companies' efforts in Eastern Europe and Romania have reached
phenomenal proportions, and more and more people -- especially the young --

are smoking more than ever before.

We have here a public health epidemic. There is virtually no education
about the dangers of smoking: Even the doctors smoke.

There is a conviction that it is Western, glamorous and American to
smoke. Meanwhile, the life expectancy of Romanians -- already one of the
shortest in Europe -- is decreasing.

20-minute walk through the center of town revealed the following:

In front of the 14th century Gothic St. Michael's Church is a Winston
billboard, showing an eagle soaring above the New York skyline, with the
slogan “The Taste of Freedom."

Behind the church, in a city park beside a statue of Hungarian Prince
Matthew Corvin, Camel has erected a big safari tent where free cigarettes
are offered to all.

In front of the tent are two Range Rover 4x4s with French plates but

Subject: FW: Vent. Guidelines 11/26/96
To: Berlind, Mark; Winokur, Matt

Mayada is correct in her statement regarding conflict of these draft ventilation
guidelines with respect to "adapted" individuals. The ASHRAE comments state
"There is no justification or clarification of why adapted occupants became the
basis for determining ventilation rats. The strongest scientific basis for
determination of ventilation rates is based on unadapted persons. There is no
standard method to determine how an adapted occupant of a space can be satisfied
other confounding indoor environmental factors ..... "

We need to resolve this difference. Otherwise I think the guidelines look
great. They sure are expanded in content since our meeting together.

The attached files are the article and accompanying editorial published today in the Journal of the National Cancer institute
on the study suggesting that smokers are taking in more tar and nicotine than federal guidelines assume they do. Authors
of the editorial included Judith Wilkenfeld (Committee on Tobacco Product Change), Jack Henningfieid, and John Slade.
The editorial states that the FTC method of testing cigarettes for tar and nicotine provides the tobacco companies an
opportunity to mislead the public. Judy

Ron, what caused the pack moisture to be this high?

These are all the results seen for the year of 1997. As you can see it is one of our big
runs. Looking back into CTMS, we ran 2 cans to 185 on 12/30/97. This is where the
Phase 111‘s came from . There wasn't any in house pack moistures taken from this unit.
One can of the same product was ran in 3B4 over the same time frame. There was 1
sample taken from this machine. (Results were 11,93) This is .18 above target. I spoke
with Jerry Manuel about how this blend was put up and after looking at the information,
we concluded it was put up appr<<File Attachment: MA16327.XLS>>ximately +.20
heavy. Looking at the one result we received, it tracks this thought. I can‘t explain the
numbers seen on the Phase III, but we are tracking OK using Cate/Fate.

wow! while i realize this is still an in-progress project and costs are estimated, i just
wanted to thank you for a great job. and how quickly you were able to get it to us.

i'm especially impressed at all the centerspreads you have already been able to conﬁrm.
that‘s terriﬁc, and a big cost saver!

I also think your decisions to remove titles (e. g., trips, people) were wise decisions. and
i'm very excited that CAMEL will have the ﬁrst tobacco advertising to grace the pages of
Wired! and in a very impactful way!

thanks too for adding those notes -- especially pointing out major changes such as Bikini

going perfect bound with new specs as of the October issue, and Rolling Stone going
perfect bound for the 1 1/12 issue.

.Brice/Don: we need to make some decisions quick. while sue has verbally committed, the

magazines will want to have hard insertion orders to absolutely guarantee positions such
as centerspread, and so Sue can negotiate the best up-front position for our insert where
centerspread doesn‘t apply. as soon as LHC can issue the orders, the better.
So we have to make some decisions and need approval as quickly as we can get it on the

Attached are revised notes from our last meeting in Dec. and subsequent discussions with several of

Pls review carefully and provide feedback, we need to finalize this general outline and then move

Clearly some of these items are long term efforts, but we need to provide tools to the RD's, and more
importantly, a broad plan they can utilize in their own states in ‘99 and beyond.

Scott/Pam/Henry/Dan/Ted —- we need to pull a real plan together for each of the legislative orgs listed
in the plan, and perhaps others. BUT, we must coordinate with YSP and follow their lead re:
thoughts on how best they can support/complement our efforts. And there is the issue of over
committing YSP and being streched too thin that we must always consider.

I am happy to work with each of you along with KD, in pulling those plans together, with an emphasis
on substantive policy results, not PR. As meetings are fast approaching, how does the end on
January sound for a deadline?

Subject: RE: 03st Christmas

Agree w/ the simplicity of the piece and the opportunity to dimensionalize Cowboy's Christmas for our YAS
direct audience. I also think a "Card" format in the spirit of Cowboy's Christmas might be a nice Qgtion to i think

"holiday" - cards are nice personal touch on any holiday, especially one that so relates to Marlboro. You know,
like the YAS stated last night in qualitative. "i only open personal mail" — beautiful card. regular card envelope,
special return address, looks likes it's from a friend (it is), explanation of the CXmas on the back of the card only -
not in the middle told at all. Like Hallmark, most people look at the back of a great card. it might even

Though I agree that it might not be a compelling trial otter for competitive YAS, it they are alternate purchasers.
it's a great value. in fact, in a recent focus group (can't remember which one), an adult consumer stated that
he buys the BSG2F deal and splits it among other adult smoker friends.

Though I understand that we are restricted with how we request GllD (and budget) - this might have been an
appropriate time to ask for their GIID [separate piece w/in envelope) and send them a nice non—branded

item/ gift for CXmas. (Silver scrolled lighter). Though again, it might be too promotional - more marketing "to"
them than just a nice personal message.

build ideas and comments into a book, which will be distributed over the next few days. What is coming in to Mike on the

Subject: SIS Pricing System


This requests your help with an analysis to evaluate a tactical change to the execution of our pricing

Background:
 

Jim Maguire has suggested we simplify the execution of the pricing strategies by determining a division-
wide discount value for our FP brands rather than the rep determining the discount value on a store by store
basis. In order to evaluate that tactical change, we want to simulate it first.

Methodology:
0 Sort stores by division, and class of trade within division (SM, CG. CO, and all other ex Ml)

$0.35/3350 price gap vs Branded Savings across stores in which the rep has executed a discount,
Round the simulated discount value to the nearest nickel for packs and the nearest $0.50 for cartons. If
the rep has not executed a discount, do not include that store in the average and do not substitute an
average discount value for that store. The discount value for stores in which the rep has not executed a
discount should remain zero.

I For each store in each class of trade/division combination, substitute the average discount value for the
discount value actually worked. (Again it' the discount value is zero, it should remain zero.)

' Create a dummy databasejust like the real database but with simulated values for discounts and net
prices.

- Run our current grid store only reports against the dummy database to enable BlAD comparisons of the
simulated reports vs the actual current reports. This will enable us to evaluate the impact of the tactieal
change on the data and very importantly enable us to estimate the ﬁnancial impact.

I don’t know how this request compares to priorities outside the pricing system. Ernie indicates that Jim

Magtiire asks him about this daily. ’l'herefore, Ernie has asked that we complete this analysis by the end of
the week,

be held in Davenport, Cedar Rapids, Mason City and Sioux City,

Assume product liability legislation is included in his proposals. Do we expect
he‘s supporting?
Iowa AP wire story indicated that the tax issue is D.O.A. with Republicans,
including Branstad. On the media front, it's probably best to let the Governor
and other legislators speak out against increasing taxes of any kind. If
they're going to oppose the tax increase, we might be better off focusing the
efforts of our allies on the other components of Miller‘s agenda. Thoughts?

Subject: Ranch Roller Bag

Katie -- As discussed, Legal has a patent issue with the wheels on the catalog roller-bag. (We were reordering the
exact bag without branding for the Ranch program.) Beth and I presented this bag as a back-up option, when we
learned that there would be a long trademark search on the telescoping handle bag. We were under the impression
that this option would easily be approved. Unfortunately, this assumption was wrong, since over the past few years
(since the catalog version) a patent has been filed on the wheel housing/mechanism.

Based on this assumption of clearance, we placed an order for the first 500 ($16,750) to meet the April delivery date.
Another P0 was set up for the balance of 2,900 (for del. in late June). This PC could have been cancelled any time

in discussions today, the following resolutions have been determined:

1) Wheeled bags already produced can be distributed at Ranch. We are confirming what part of 500 are finished
to-date -— estimate: 300. Firm answer tomorrow.

2) Balance of 500 -- and entire new order of 2,900 will be produced without wheels.

3) Spec Revisions will involve: a) Moving side handle to be even with other side handle. (This was moved closer to

the base ot the bag to make for easier wheeling.)
b) Plastic runner strips on base of bag will be centered within length of bag. (Currently, they‘re closer to top end
to allow room for wheel mechanism).

We will have these spec revisions made, and forward to Christine for Jay Mohr‘s approval. Since we cannot proceed
with balance of order until we receive this approval, our second delivery date will most likely be delayed. Call if you
have questions.

Les,

The data for the TSG99 FLl459 and FLI460 cigarettes are in the following attachments.
I will also provide you with a hard copy. Included in these attachments are the LIMS
raw data, a summary, physical & material information, and a limited comparison of
previous TSG data by Lorillard to each test (includes their results on previous TSG Cig).
In each workbook attached there is an overall data sheet "I 999 TSG Burley Cigarette
Data from FL] 459 & FLl460" done in the same format as the "1992 TSG Flue-cured
Cigarette DAT ". I included as much information as Ihad from the previous TSG test.

The attached data does not include the bulk sieve analysis, but does include the
long strands, middle strands and fines for that data. Cigarette net tobacco weight
has been requested and should be available in the next day or two.

The cigarette pressure drop for FL1459AA (505, BELC-Zl) and FLI459AB (506,
BELN)

is 389 mm and 403 mm. These pressure drops are 61 mm and 93 mm higher than the
1992 TSG ﬂue-cured cigarettes and about 100 mm above FL1459AC (507, BEHC-Zl)
and

FL1459AD (508, BEHN). The 1992 Flue-cured set shows the similar difference between

COLLECTOR‘S CHOICE
VERNON CHEEK
Hi. Vernon,

As the Collector’s Choice saga becomes more confusing, [feel compelled to document a
portion of it lest we become overwhelmed by superﬂuous details.

Originally, we were going to add Red Express to the Skyline Series of

C. Choice. We had agreed that the only change to the case UPC would be

the alpha letter "A" in place of the zero in code 1950. This application

of alphas would change with each new pack replacement in the carton series. (Are we
together so far?) Red Express was to be added to the Skyline Series. That, however, was
yesterday. Today, 11/24/93, Red Express is being added to the Vista Series (code 1690).
This change is being made because the Princeton University is being adversarial about the
use of the Princeton name on a pack of cigarettes.

As I remember our conversation prior to your vacation, this change from the full ﬂavor series
switch the series in which the Red Express brand will appear. As I see it, this means that the
1690 code with now become 169A. This will represent the new Vista carton which will lose
Princeton and gain Red Express and so on and so on and so on.

This has been a great catharsis and you are a wonderful sounding board.

Dee

Weekly Report ending June 7.

This week I drafted letters for those activists in Iowa who committed to write letters on
the FDA. As you may recall we had 15 people agree to do this. As always, people
promise and then sit on the letter for days on end so I had to do quite a bit of follow-up.


David Payer - former candidate for legislature and small business owner
Jim Raife ~ health food store owner

Jim Kuhlman — health care professional

Todd Rector - Auditor

Mary Rector - Athritis sufferer

Michael Bennett - former candidate for legislature and real estate agent

The subjects of the letters covered a broad range. They included Mary Rector's inability
devices, the regulation of the health food industry, the regulation of vitamins and drug
approval. I tried to vary the topics as much as possible.

faxing you copies of the letters I do have now. I plan to do the same thing for Illinois next
week.

Anti-activist Jesse Brown will be in KC tomorrow through Saturday as part of a program
sponsored by the American Stop Smoking Intervention Study, a tobacco-control

Subject: Circulation of Revised Discovery Responses~ Form’at '

As the flow of draft discovery responses picks up, it is becoming extremely difficult and unnecessarily time
consuming to review revised drafts if they are neither, 1) in red-line format, or 2) accompanied by a cover
memo pinpointing the revisions.

working on discovery responses be reminded that they are to comply strictly with 1 or 2 above, In addition
, it would be extremely helpful if each draft were sequentially numbered in the upper right hand corner, so
that there will be no confusion during discussions as to the proper draft under consideration.
Please pass the word. Thanks,

Hi ~ thought l'd give my 2cents on the new sign holder. This is my thought (and only mine) before putting this
In front of the SDT .......

. good concept and like the flexibility of pricing changes. Could we design the Slide By to do the same -

product deal offer communication but maybe we can find a creative way to address this.

- l'm concerned about adding more signage. Though the sign is small and fundamentally more ﬂexible
than the slide-by, will we add to the fixture signage (6+ vs 3 - if you Include slide-by‘s). More importantly,
will accounts opt to remove siide-by‘s in favor of smaller signs and thereby, we have less graphic
capabilities? Just a thought to consider, or maybe you have.

I reviewed the naming/size document and feel that you can provide the necessary input....but I‘ll also give

you my 2cents.

- My thought is consistency in naming is a good thing for systems and communication input. Just keep
your marketing hat on for sizing so we don't get boxed in. A possibility is max / min total sq inches and
thus, we can work within different shapes within the total real estate. Ge. the Parliament and Milds
arrow was effective - minimal sq inches and not confined to height and width). This will also give the
agency some more ﬂexibility since frankly, sometimes are creative is forced to fit and i'd prefer the
agency be given some creative flexibility (good thing for the agency). i do think you should revisit the

smaller, maybe the some).

That's all folks. I‘m sure you'll take it in the right direction.

SETTLEMENT —- Saying that he could support a tax increase
on smokers to help pay for alternative proposals, Nickles,
R-Okla., did not provide specifics on how large a tax
increase he would support but made it clear a Democratic
plan of a gradual S 1.50—per—pack increase was out of the
question. “We are not going to pass a bill the Democrats
are looking at just to increase taxes and spend more
for any kind of tax increase to pay for a government
program in an election year may be the strongest evidence
of the commitment he and others have to passing some sort
of anti-tobacco legislation and of the pressure they are
under to come through on that commitment. Presented with
the historic agreement hammered out by the industry and
state attorneys general last year, lawmakers have been
grappling with how to respond ever since. Nickles, who for
months has been extremely negative about the chances the
tobacco settlement would be passed into law, repeatedly has
vowed to pass some sort of legislation directed at warning
teens against smoking as well as drug use. "I think we will
pass legislation this year," he said. In addition to a
government the authority to fine the tobacco industry if it
did not reduce teen smoking. Nickles became the Senate
Republican point man on the tobacco settlement late last
year. Recently Sen. John McCain, R—Ariz., chairman of the
Senate Commerce Committee, which has most of the
jurisdiction over that kind of legislation, has stepped in
as the lead Republican, at least for now. Nickles, who
serves as the Senate majority whip and holds tremendous
power over floor action, said he would take whatever came

we have confirmed our research schedule for assessing the
appropriateness of U.S. materials for Canada. We would be delighted
to have you attend the groups if your schedule allows. We will be
receiving the draft discussion guides tomorrow. Are you interested in
reviewing them?? The groups have been designed to provide us with
major market vs perimeter vs rural perceptions. Guelph is "rural", and
Mississauga is "perimeter”. Toronto (core) tends to be more jaded
perceptions in developing the Canadian program.

Guys -

Mr. Johnston has received a letter, which was forwarded to me, and I subsequently
received a phone call from... a Sally Wilson. Sally is an employee of the New York
Metropolitan Authority.

Where she works, they have separately ventilated smoking rooms. They have used them

getting complaints, and they could no longer smoke there at all. Have to step outside.

To be candid, up front, lhave to tell you that Sally sounds to me like one of those "what
have you done for me in the last five minutes?" types. Rather pushy, fairly humorless,
etc.

But, it sounds like they are really, really getting the short end of the stick if, as she says,
they truly have separately ventilated rooms and can't even use them anymore.

She wants our help. Ultimately, this one looks like it is an organizational/activist
challenge. Maybe someone should go to New York and meet with her. See what they can
do to help from an activist/organizational standpoint. Who do we have that works N. Y.
C. these days? If we were able to help them out, it might be a nice success story for New
York.

Frankly, if they already have separately ventilated rooms, and have now been kicked-out
of those, there is nothing - nada, zippo - we can do from a technical or ventilation
standpoint.

We can and will, share our "workplace policy" information with her. Beyond that, if we
need to send someone there to satisfy her, I think we should. But ﬁrst I think we should

Media Folks,

Parliament presented brand plans to Mike and Bob on Friday. Mike requested a plan and $ needed if we were to consider
expanding Parliament's media support to all of Region 1 (- Bangor). Since we are already in print in all of R1, this is an
OOH exercise. Could you please have the Agency work up a recommendation for 1996 and include appropriate levels
needed for first~time OOH in these markets. I will need the plan by November 13th.

In the end, we can prioritize markets contingent upon any incremental $ received. l'd like to submit a plan for all R1—
Bangor going in. l'm here if you have any questions.

Lauren— in the meantime, while the media folks are looking at all markets (—Bangor) in REgion 1 equally, please pull
Parliament's share in each R1 market and look at marrying with RDM by market in order to prioritize markets (if needed)
based on any incremental dollars received. We may want to go down to the county level?? Thanks.

Yes, we do. But our Regional Government Affairs people take the lead in recommending actions,
confronts fires in several states. Normally we would not act unless there is widespread damage and
victims numbering in the thousands. Were we to respond, we would need to have the particulars (tax
l.D., address, contact. phone, etc.) for the grantee. Also, we would probably check with the Red Cross
to see what the needs are so we do not duplicate. Finally, we could consider a shipment of food from
Kraft. So for that reason, I'm also copying Kathy Spear, who is our Task Force leader for KFNA. Let's
see what Ginny says.

A CBS producer by the name of Rebecca Peterson (sp?) located in the Washington office (202—973-0779) called
and asked to film at the TlTL Laboratory for a story they are planning for November on low tar cigarettes.

Both RJR and PM were in favor of letting them come in and film without giving an interview while 823W and Lorr.
come from it.

Further discussion resulted in the following action: Mara Payne of RJR will telephone the producer to acquire
more details of the requested ﬁlming and report back to the Board of Directors early next week. in any event,
there was strong sentiment that TlTL not speak for the industry, however, if individual Companies wanted to grant
an interview, they were free to do so.

i will provide you with more details as i receive them. it would appear that we at PM need to decide it we are going
to grant an interview with this producer and plan to proceed accordingly.

Morning Team Notes 7/26 Date: 7/30/96
Cattaraugus County, N Y—-At recent public hearing, county legislators heard five retailers
speak out against the self -service display ban proposal and only one citizen speak for it.
The legislators decided to re—refer the bill to committee because they said it was too
broad the way it was written. They won't bring it back until after Labor Day at the very
earliest. Over in Chautauqua County, the legislators will consider exempting cigars and
making a "3-1" oot from the register" exception for smokeless when an amendment is heard

This could give cigarette retailers an opportunity to go back in an maybe at least get some
space 011 the the counter—mot just behind it. The local Rite-Aid drug chain, with five
stores in the county, is mainly pushing for the Cigar, smokeless exception.

Tobacco Weekly Valuations

LAST WEEK

* Philip Morris (Restricted, $25.69), UST (Hold, $14.56)
and RJ

Reynolds (Buy, $28.13) all outperformed the market last
week with respective
one—week returns of 1.2%, 4.0% and -2.6% compared with a
market return of

—4.1%.

* Philip Morris led a $0.06 per pack wholesale price
increase on

Friday, July 28 effective today, July 31 on all its premium
and discount
brands. We expect the other cigarette manufacturers to
follow. The $0.06 ‘

represents a 2.8% weighted average increase including
excise taxes. This

translates into a $0.08 per pack increase for the consumer.
We do not

believe this modest price increase is needed to offset
higher settlement

payment increases in the short term and should be offset by
promotions.

We think that some of these may be the same. but the Information that was sent to us from your factory is not
always consistent as far as nomenclature or supplier name (for example, Olpa vs Olsanske).

Please supply a supplier reference number for the Term tipping used on Kossuth Filter. The size Is not enough

We also still need a sample of the triacetln that you use from Akzo Chemical.

We have a November 1 deadline so i hope to hear from you soon.

Newspaper Reader Profile Service. Last November, ABC agreed to proceed in refining
research standrads and audit processes. The purpose of this Reader Proﬁle Service was to
enhance comparison of audience profiles of newspapers across the country.

You had asked me to remind you about this study in early July so you could check on it
when you attended the ABC meeting this month. Ithought it might be interesting to get
the results of the early test participants. Newspaper readership could vary from market to
market, especially given the availability of other "news" sources from market to market.
A market with a strong alternative newspaper might skew the readership of the daily
newspaper older, and if this press is non-existent, the 21-29 might be forced to read the
daily newspaper to learn about club events, etc. If you want the newsletter to refresh your
memory - let me know and i‘ll give it to you.

Winton, in Planning 1997 programs we have been hampered by two factors:
A) What will be our split of Gratis VS Coupons (Age Veriﬁcation x Non-
restrictcd/Restricted States)

((Our last look prior to DB records being sent to third party sources for Age verification
netted

us around 30% of N on-restricted states - being Age Verified!»

target

may split - potentially - a large % could be Bad bets.

1 will not be able to begin to project Question B until Inbound targeting is in place
sometime in September.

But, the database was loaded with the results of third party Age veriﬁcation last week, so
lpulled a small analysis to see the results against Camel target.

As the attachment shows, overall about 60% are Age Verified in Non-restricted States.
Given our smaller target Plan numbers in 1997, we could potentially only target Age
veriﬁed smokers in Non-restricted states. This would of course be the best possible offer.
We know via research and analysis that getting product in hand is key to improved
Conversion results.

In addition to potentially consider mailing only where we can send gratis, there are other
targeting strategies to consider. Another view would be to look at Camel priority Markets
x Gratis Restrictions/Age Verification. Even though Couponing is not as efficient, and
yields a lower overall % of Conversion, we may opt to concentrate only in strongholds
Vs national. Now I've given you food for thought for two Non-national strategies .....

We have not considered either of these strategies, or any other Non-national strategies
previously because of the mass quantities of smokers we needed to put through

Subject: RE: 6' and 8' 0PM Conversion

As a reminder, my recommendation is not to ship OPMs to retail accounts with a missing
panel in the OPM. Our accounts and FSF will be confused and we would have just created
total chaos at field level.
Additionally, by placing these items on hold we are confronted with potential rejected orders or
confusion as we are just beginning the new allocation process.

The plan we should be looking at is establishing a clear Game Plan & communications to
Madden and HUB agents collectively,

Harbor has about 100 message panels in spare parts and plans to ship them to Roselle on
Monday (Bulk). Secondly, Bob met with Molly, an prepares a PC for 3,000 + (depending on
open orders from Stacey and projected number at TPI ) Message panels for 6' & 8' OPMs.

Hub recaps to Madden the total number of OPMs they have at each TPI depot that needs to
be retrofitted.

A labor force is hired and is sent to Roselle to open all 6‘ & 8' opms and remove the clocks
and make one good 0PM from 2 OPMs (marking each completed 0PM with a retroﬁtted
sticker). Additional panels would be shipped from Roselle to TPi depots to have agents retrofit
them PRIOR to the day they are to be installed. (Documentation outline to follow)

Once the production of the Panels are completed from Harbor they are shipped to Roselle and
the remaining OPMs are made whole using the hired labor force again.

I know this is not the complete process flow, but does present a solution with out upsetting our
current process.

Claire raises a good point re records retention. You should review your functional records retention schedule and
make determinations aboutwhether the samples you describe are under disposal suspension. If they are, they
must be retained until the disposal suspension is listed. it they are not, they must be retained in accordance with
your retention schedule. if you have questions about the application of the schedule, contact your records

With reasonable advance notice, we will be happy to arrange a PMT/FLT Meeting to accommodate
YSP during 4th Quarter, 1999. The PMT is scheduled to meet on the dates below, from 8:00 am. to
12:00 noon. if one of these windows meets NY needs. then we could expand the meeting to include

Oct. 14
Oct. 21
Oct. 28
Nov. 4
Nov. 11
Nov. 18
Dec. 2
Dec. 9

Alternative dates can also be arranged. At least this will give you a place to start! (if NY would like to

suggest several dates that are convenient for them, I will gladly follow up to make arrangements on
this end.)

Subject: CORRECTION: Company Cellular Phone PIN

Attachments:

 

 


Effective Monday, May 13, CellularONE will introduce a new technology. It's called
deterring fraudulent cellular use.

The PIN is necessary to allow you to place calls while roaming outside of North Carolina.
While traveling, you will need to enter the PIN each day before placing your ﬁrst call,
entering a new city, when you return to North Carolina and anytime your call cannot be
completed. Also, if you are working or traveling past midnight on any given day, you will
have to re-enter the PIN at that time.

PROCEDURE:

When you are roaming and after you have powered up your phone, you will dial *560,
the PIN, [SEND] and [END]. This activates the phone and makes it available to place
calls. You only have to do this once each day, so long as you remain in the same service

that a holding statement he prepared. Could you give me your facts input such as
I Start and end of clinical trial

Number and characteristics of subjects (e.g., gender, race, voluntary and reimbursed, pregnancy, age)

CRO and principal investigator

How is addressed that subjects are not exposed to increased risks

How does the test smoking relate to the ’normal‘ smoking of the subjects?

What is the purpose of the study?

Tavern on the Green is the only TAP participant, however, several of the others allow
smoking.

Since I don’t know the restaurateurs personally, I was wondering if you had a personal

McMahon, Kathy

Briggs, Gary(K0wal); Grosskopf, Neil; Mansmann, Jack

Can we verify that the scripting is correct regarding how often retailers can call to order
catalogs.
CSRs should say that a retailer can call to order catalogs once a day. In the beginning of the
last program we said once a week. We were concerned about not having sufficient catalog
inventory. since proved not to be an issue so we can allow retailers to call and order catalogs
more often - once a day.

get the RD's in the loop. He's happy to do a presentation if they're all

together, but since that's not happening for a while ...... I think the way we
want to proceed is just asking the RD's to get in touch with VPRS‘s or SSD‘S

in their area to arrange to sit in on one of the roll-out meetings.

The new program is being presented at each of the current regional LEAP
meetings. One meeting for each of the 5 regions. Regions 3 and 4 are done,
but 1,2 and 5 still to go, so the RD‘s can call the corresponding VPRS‘s if
they'd like to attend for the 3rd day of the LEAP meeting (that‘s when RL
program will be presented). After that, there will be district by district
meetings with the TSM's to go through the program in detail. The RD's can
call their SSD contact(s) to arrange to sit in on any of those meetings.

Hello Everyone,

Enclosed is the April 2000 Menu Roll Up spread sheet for the Marlboro BSG2F promotion. There are only
seven items on the list. As a result, the budgets are lower than normal. Other items will be available to

Charlie,

The increase in nitrate from our blends could be attributed to increase in by~products in
the DORAL family versus Winston family. Both burley and ﬂue-cured stems have higher

nitrate levels than their leaf counterparts. I would expect higher by—products to also be
used in competitive lower-priced products.

Todd, do you know if any planning has taken place on the 97 mail kits for the two races
in Florida where we will be doing personal selling?

Last year the Winston Kit was a letter about the race, and two coupons. Both expired
12/31/96 — one was for $3 off 4 packs or 1 carton, and the other was a BlGlF. Lindsay's
group provided a paragraph about the race to Brenda Grandcrson in Consumer Relations
and she incorporated the paragraph into a letter. The letter was actually run on legal-size
paper, with the two coupons as tear-oi" f s on the bottom of the letter. I have a sample of the
paper, coupons, and envelope used. Included with the letter was a survey about future
purchase intent.

have to be printed, and the survey may need to be revised.

Pls let me know. Thanks.

Dear Carolyn, I expect that we will be in a position to put together a Phase
1 report in about two months - if we can complete the two ongoing groups
without a set back. By that time, we should have completed two pilot groups.


The earliest we could start a third group is in January. The Phase 1 report
and Follow-up Questionnaires, a description of the smoking cessation group
program, and the initial outcome of two (or three) pilot groups. We will

also describe our recruitment strategies and lessons learned from Phase 1.
Have a nice ﬂight and great holiday. Best regards, Norman

Dear Mr. Leighton:
We appreciate your loyalty to the Doral brand of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. We are sorry that you have chosen
not to collect the cards afﬁliated with the Celebrate America Collector Cards program, «We created the program as a

intended to give extra value to our adult smokers. The cards were developed in response to the interests of Doral
smokers. We surveyed Doral smokers about their interests and hobbies last year and nearly half of them told us that
they are "collectors." The Doral collector cards align with these adult smokers' general interest in collectibles.

The intent of the program is absolutely not designed to get you to smoke more cigarettes, We‘ve found that most of
our smokers have enjoyed reading and collecting these cards and would << be able to collect most of the cards
through their normal purchases of Doral. Wtably—beabletommeacmssau—ouheeards;

Problems

Most of this week has been dedicated to ﬁnd a solution to an EMM386 error that's
occurring on several PC machines, mostly in the Training Room. I talked to a Microsoft
engineer about this problem in great detail. He tells me the Upper Memory Blocks on the PC
machines are incorrectly mapped by PC applications. He instructed me how to exclude regions
of memory from being mapped. However, it did not solve the problem. I will continue to bug
Microsoft.

Also, last Wednesday, a problem with the network was being affected throughout the
building. I and several users were hit with dropped connections or Microsoft Mail errors. I

didn't think to look at our sniffer to see if there was anything loading the system. If it happens
again, I’ll investigate the sniffer.

Opportunities

Most of the Statisticians group and myself met to discuss SAS. I demonstrated how to
connect and install the server application. With the exception of Mike Morton trying to print his
data, most are ready to evaluate the SAS application.

Mary Ann and I helped Patrice Sigmon with her Workgroups classes.

Cheryl,

Thanks for’giving ‘ ea copy of your memo on a procedure for sample inventory control. I don’t know it your
thoughts will have been influenced by your trip to Lancaster Labs by the time you get this email. Your plan definitely cuts
through the clutter on finding samples from the current season. One question I have is how will we handle future sample
consolidation. That is, as a few seasons pass we may want to consolidate a limited number of samples from the past—tor
example, high TSNA samples resulting lrorn a special curing program-into a new location. Would we then need to prepare
a new sample label with a new location code?

One Indication is through a ec. 12. 1 69 memo from Murray Senkus

had where Crohn asked how reports t at could later prove damaging to

The memo goes on to say: "While the strategy was brilliantly
conceived and executed over the years helping us win important

Perhaps we can have a call with Claire and discuss what other substantiation they are submitting to

Dear all:
As promised, attached please ﬁnd the milestone status report for the period 1/1/01 - 3/1/01. The attachment details
those project milestones due to be completed by March 1st.

As with last year, we will continue to use reporting by exception. If the milestones were met, there is no need to
respond. If, however, you have a missed or delayed milestone, I need from you by [Emu on MIA:

o a brief but speciﬁc explanation of why the milestone was not met.

If a delay is related to a resource issue (internal or external) please be sure to indicate this in your feedback. Those
milestones in the attachment for which i do not receive any indication ofa delay will be marked "complete" in the
database after 3/14.

Keep in mind that ifa delayed milestone is causing other target dates in your project to slip, you need to provide me
with updated dates for those milestones as well. You can include that in your feedback to this report or send me that
information separately (email or updated project sheet; either is ﬁne).
Let me know if questions.

Thanks,
Valerie

Frau Viol: Could you please circulate this to the INBIFO project leaders as appropriate. Thanks.
