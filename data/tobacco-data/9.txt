PROJECT‘TITLE : Cast Leaf Development
PROJECT LEADER : G. Gellatly
PERIOD COVERED : September, 1991


A.
Obiectiv : Develop subjectively and physically acceptable recomtitutcd tobacco sheets
for domestic and international application using Cast Leaf technology and proprietary
binder systems.

October 11. The grinding area should be operational by December. 'Ihe'latest schedule
includes a shipping date of November 8th for the grinder and November 22nd for the
cyclone, ductwork and dust collector. The dry ribbon blender and dust feeder will be
installed in November so that we can blend dust ground off site.

 
plant and laboratory Job Safe Procedures are also completed.

Cast Leaf Development - Laboratory studies with hand cast sheets have shown that the
addition of guar gum binder to prewetted tobacco in the absence of DAP produces
quality. The mechanism of this phenomenon is believed to be a slower guar hydration
rate allowing better tobacco hydration to occur. Larger quantities of ﬁne and coarse guar
have been ordered for conﬁrmation of this phenomenon in the Cast Leaf Pilot Plant.

A preliminary analysis of 24% recon cigarettes indicated that the DAP content of the
recon is a major factor affecting tar and nicotine delivery, puff count, and static burn.
production RLB, RLTC, and RCB which cover a wide range of sheet density.

Cadiz - Preliminary chemical analysis of the Cadiz trial products in August are
satisfactory. The bulk products are expected to be received in USA in October for
subjective and survivability assessment.

BL Plant Capacity Increase - The Richmond panel detected differences in BL produced
at higher line speeds (330 vs 350 fpm). Modiﬁcation of the dryer proﬁle moved the
subjective response closer to the control however additional trials, planned for October,

are required to qualify the linespced up.

Alternate Sheet Suppliers - Q ‘-' Differences were detected in Marlboro containing
LTR sheet substituted for RLTC at a full (6.6%) and half (3.3%) replacement. The
ﬁndings were reviewed with M. Schulz from PME Leaf. Additional trials are planned at
LTR to produce sheet with European feedstocks for evaluation in a Pan European
Marlboro.

PROGRAM TITLE : Flavor Transfer
PERIOD COVERED: February 3 - 28, 1975
WRITTEN BY : R. M. Ikeda

I. Smoke Flavor Studiesl

Six of the important volatile odor constituents of TPM were
measured for the diluted 8 mg and the all-strip non-filtered cigarettes.
These compounds were added to the diluted 8 mg cigarette to raise
their deliveries to the levels of the all-strip non-filtered cigarettes.

Subjective evaluations are being carried out on these fortified 8 mg
cigarettes.

II. Flavor Transfera

Procedures for the analysis of the hydrocarbons in filler and
smoke have been established for the study of the transfer of these
compounds from filler to smoke. There are losses of the added Clo-C13
hydrocarbons in this procedure. Investigations are underway to determine

where these losses are occurring.
III. Hydrocarbon Markers3

Saturated hydrocarbons (Cls-C17) were added to aftercut solution
and sprayed On fillers of various brands of cigarettes. These hydro-
identify various aftercut solutions applied to filler.

IV. Sugar Replacement4

A study has been started to determine if dextrin can—be sub-
stituted for sucrose in the burley spray. Dextrin has been substituted
for sucrose at 25, 50, 75 and 100% levels. Initially all burley

cigarettes will be made and tested subjectively.

INTERFERENCE

Flasks must be clean, dry and free of zinc before analyzing any samples. Any residual zinc left in a
{task would react with the MH in the predigcstion phase. thus giving lower results. Any water left in
the ﬂask would. have to be boiled oft‘ prior to reaching the proper temperature. Also. tobacco would
have a tendency to cling to the ﬂask if wet, not allowing all of the sample to be pro/digested.

Abstract. A 24 amino acid polypeptide that does not originate from (pre)proenkephalin has been isolated from mine
adrenal chromafﬁn granules. [15 sequence is: Arg-l.eu-l’ro-Gly-le[cu-Arg-Asnfl'yr-Leu-Asp-Tyr~Gly~Glu-Glu-Val—

Gly~Glu-Glu-Ala-A|a-Arg-Gly-Vttl. This peptide is generate

banks shows very little homology to any known protein.

volved in (pre)proenkephalin processing in both bovine
and ovine adrenal medullary cells [for review see ref. 5], we
have isolated a number of opioid and nonopioid peptides
derived from proenkcphalin [6, 12. 13]. We have also ob-
served a number of other peptides whose sequences were
not contained in the prohormone sequence [l, 7]. These
peptides were present in amounts equal to or greater than
the proenkephalin fragments and exhibited no cross-reac-
tivity with antisera against Met- and Lcu-enkephalin. We
present here the puriﬁcation and sequence ofa peptide and
its precursor from ovine adrenal chmmafﬁn granules that
are not derived from proenkephalin and which may be phy-
siologically active peptides secreted by the adrenal me-
dulla.


Fresh ovine adrenal glands were obtained from the slaughter-
house and kept on ice until dissection. Upon removal ofthe cortex,
tial centrifugation as described elsewhere [2] and stored at ~80 °(‘.

The guanosine triphosphate (GTP)vbinding protein Rae functions in regulating growth and
differentiation; however, little is known about the protein interactions that bring about its
biological activity. Wild-type Ras or mutant terms of Ftas were covalently attached to an
insoluble matrix and then used to examine the interaction of signaling proteins with Ftas.
Forms of Ras activated either by mutation (Gly12Val) or by binding of the GTP analog.
guanylyI-imidodiphosphate (GMP-PNP) interacted speciﬁcally with Raf-1 whereas an et-
fector domain mutant. lle36Ala. failed to interact with Fiat-1. Mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAP kinase) activity was only associated with activated forms of Ras. The specific
interaction of actiVated Has with active MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK) was confirmed by
direct assays. Thus the forming of complexes containing MAPKK activity and Raf-1 protein

are dependent upon the activity of Ftas.

in signaling between the cell membrane
and the cytosol. the biochemical interac-
tions that mediate the action of Ras are
poorly understood. To determine if Ras
might physically interact with cytosolic

silica beads activated by an N-hydroxyl
succinimide group (11, l2). The coupled
Ras was active in binding guanine nuclei

interactions between Ras and neuroﬁbro-
min, a regulator of Ras function (12). The
immobilized Ras was used to probe rat
brain cytosol for signaling proteins that

Immobilized Ras bound to GMP-PNP (aj'
nonhydrolyzable GTP analog) formed a sta~
ble complex with Raf-1 (Fig. 1A). Approx-

10% as effective as wild-type Ras in forming
stable complexes with Raf—1 (Fig. 1A). An

even smaller amount of Raf-l associated

GMP-PNP failed to bind detectable
amounts of Raf-1 (Fig. 1B). Thus, the stable
association of Raf-l with immobilized Ras
correlated well with the formation of the
active GTP-bound form of Ras.

We investigated the GTP-dependent as-

by J. DA Heck, R. s. Lake, and R. D. Leverette

The journal Science published in its October 18 issue a study by
Mikhail Denissenko and colleagues which describes EMA adduct
patterns in the P53 gene of cultured cells exposed to
benzo{a3pyrene diol epoxide {839E}. The most frequent sites for
this in Vitro adduct formation were compared to a previously—
published database which has inventoried the sites of mutation in
the PS3 gene of human tumors. Publication of the pager was
accompanied by a flurry of reports in the print and broadcast
news media which grossly overinterereted the actual findings of
the investigators. The following statement is based on our own
review of the paper and briefly references a substantial and
very different perspective on the biological significance of
benzofa}pyrene (B[a2P) in cigarette smoke.


The P53 gene’s ultimate product is a protein which normally acts
as a transcription factor that participates in the regulation of
other genes involved in a variety of fundamental cell functions,
including cell growth control, DNA repair, and the initiation of
apoptosis {programmed cell death). 953 is a highly conserved
gene which has been identified in many species. It is also the
heman gene most frequently identitied as being altered by
mutation in.a variety of human cancers, with mutations having
been identified-at the4majority of PSB’s 393 codons (3 DNA
nucleotide coding units which specify individual amino acids of
the P53 protein). Over 58% of human tumors aealyzed to date from
various sites, including the lung, have been found to have PS3

2 RESEARCH CIGARETTES

The research cigarette types SIRIUS-A and -B, both filter
tants in the filler. SIRIUS-A contained 1.9 percent glycerol,
1.4 percent propylene glycol, and 0.8 percent triethylene glycol.
tion in the filler of both research cigarette types was approx.
4 percent. The standard reference cigarette 2R1 was used as an in—

ternal control.

3 METHOD

The study was performed according to INBIFO standard operating
procedures. Three MWS and 3 SWS doses were administered. For MWS,
the doses were between 0.2 and 1.0 “milligrams” TPM per flask and
for SWS between 0.1 and 0.6 "milligrams" TPM per flask. There were

was active in the T-cell assay and well separated from the void peak (which might contain
undigested material) was further fractionated by HPLC using a C18 reverse phase column.
An active peak was then fractionated on a high resolution ion exchange column (Dionex,
Omnipac NA—l 00), yielding six peaks. 5 of which were extremely sharp. Only one peak
Rockefeller University, revealed that this peak consisted of an incomplete digestion prod-
not having a molecular weight of 8612. Only a single molecular weight species was
detected. N—tenninal sequencing of the ﬁrst 10 residues in the Howard Hughes Protein
Core facility revealed a single sequence (xxLxxIxFQT) which was sufﬁcient to identify the
N-terminus of the ovalbumin peptide (ova 127). On the assumption that lysine was essen-
tial (based on data not shown) . ova 185-207 was synthesized and found to be active. We
are now synthesizing additional peptides to determine the boundaries of the epitope.
Second. we have begun a determination of the v-region sequences of the B-lymphom'a hy-
cial vector . Clones with inserts of the correct size have been sequenced in the Cancer Cen-
ter core facility. The heavy chain v-region sequence of the B-lymphoma fusion partner
(A20.2J.PF) has been completed in this laboratory. To continue this work, we have begun a
collaboration with Dr. Inghirami. a coinvestigator on this application, who has extensive
experience with v—region sequencing. When the v-region sequences of the B-lymphoma
hybrid are in hand, synthetic peptides based on these sequences will be tested with the T-
cell hybridoma. If our hypothesis is correct, one of the vvregion peptides should stimulate
the ova~speciﬁc T hybrid. -

Aims.
The ﬁrst aim will be to complete the characterization of the ova epitope recognized
by 32—6.F12. using synthetic peptides. ‘

A second aim is to sequence the v-regions of the putative residue internal image B-
lymphoma hybrid 41-6.A6(l.B9) in order to prepare synthetic Varegion peptides. The resi-

due intemal image assignment requires the identiﬁcation of a synthetic v-region peptide
that is stimulatory fer 32-6.Fl2.

A third aim will be to test our hypothesis that T-cell recognized internal images play
a role in physiologic responses to foreign antigens. We will study fusions prepared with
splenocytes from unimmunized mice and mice undergoing primary and secondary respons-
es to ovalbumm. .

A fourth aim will be to determine the degree of sequence homology between v-re-
gion and ova peptides that is required for functional imagery. This is of great interest since
the frequency of residue internal images in the repertoire wrll depend on the degree of
homology required. - -

Budget: I estimate that this project can be completed in 3 years with annual direct costs of
approru'mately $85,000. -

ABSTRACT

studies done on the lungs of smokers and non-smokers who
have inhaled small quantities of iron oxide powder, Cohen
et al claim that the dust clearance ability of the ciga-
rette smoker's lung is markedly impaired. A re-inter-
pretation of this data which casts serious doubt on the
logic of Cohen's conclusion was suggested by sterling and
is based upon the hypothesis that during the magnet—
ization phase of Cohen's experiment. iron oxide "clus-
filled environment of the smoker's bronchi.

In order to test this hypothesis. in-vitro experi-
ments have been performed to measure the mean "cluster“I
diameter of iron oxide powder in a mucous-like liquid
medium (methylcellulose) during and after magnetization
as functions of the solution viscosity. Results of these
measurements will be presented.


in a recent paper based upon the results of magnet-
ization studies of the lungs of smokers and non-smokers.
Cohen et al(1) stated that the dust clearance ability of
the cigarette smokers' lungs is markedly impaired. Con-
siderable doubt has been cast on this conclusion by
Sterling(2) who has re-interpreted Cohen's magnetization
data using the hypothesis that magnetic clusters were
presence of excessive sputun.(a) In order to test this
to measure the diameter of iron oxide fstrings' and
clusters formed in a mucous or sputum-like median after
magnetization.

it is clear that the validity of Cohen's conclusion
hinges upon the assumption that the iron oxide dust which
remains in the subjects' lungs after the magnetization
procedure, has identical physical characteristics in both
smokers and non-smokers. While there is no simple way to
demonstrate the truth of this assumption in-vivo. it is
possible to show in-vitro that it is false and that. in
fact. the experimental procedure itself may cause the
iron oxide dust in smokers' lungs to form clusters which
cannot be easily cleared.

PRELIMINARY EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDY OF THE EFFECTS OF SMOKING ON ELDERLY
POPULATION AT HIGH RISK FOR ALZHEIMER‘S DISEASE

positive family history of AD. However, it was not until work conducted by
Breitner and Folstein that it became clear how powerful an effect genetics may
play in AD (1). According to these investigators Alzheimer's probands with
characteristic symptoms of apraxia or aphasia, have first degree relatives whose
cumulative incidence of AD approaches 50% by age 90. These results may suggest
that the most common form of Alzheimer's disease is transmitted by an autosomal
because most people with the gene do not live long enough to show AD. When the
mortality tables for the United States population are superimposed on this genetic
model of Alzheimer's disease, it is apparent that approximately one-sixth of all


Figure 1 provides additional evidence in favor of genetic causes in
Alzheimer's disease. This figure summarizes results from the study of
approximately 60 AD cases (probands) and 300 first degree relatives. As was
predicted by previous work, these first degree relatives have a cumulative
incidence of Alzheimer's disease that approaches 50% by age 90. Although other
models of inheritance could fit these data, the data are clearly consistent with the
suggestion that Alzheimer's disease is caused by an autosomal dominant gene whose

expression occurs very late in life.

Whatever genetic model is used to explain these data, it is clear that first
degree relatives of Alzheimer's patients constitute a group at high risk for the
expression of Alzheimer's disease, and that this risk increases dramatically with

age. Hence, this is an ideal population in which to study factors affecting the

Because most of all US. businesses have smoking policies, federal regulation that
encourages the use of individualized policies should be helpﬁII to business. Snell ﬂexibility will also

Simple spatial separation of smokers and nonsmokers in the workplace has a
profound eﬁ‘ect upon nonsmoker exposure to ETS, Depending upon the conﬁguration of individual
workplaces, exposures of nonsmokers to ETS constituents reportedly have been reduced
dramatically — in some instances, to levels at or below the limits of detection or quantitation for air
monitoring devices. Further, simple spatial separation of smokers and nonsmokers has prov-
effective in minimizing nonsmoker exposure to ETS in a variety of settings under various existing

Acquisition of Source Signatures and Receptor Modeling
Santiago de Chile and Sao Paulo, Brazil
Antonio H. Miguel
University of California
Riverside, CA

Brief Description

The investigator proposes to test the hypotheses that, (a) the net transport of ﬁne particles and
volatile organic compounds (VOC’s) indoors from outdoor air accounts for a signiﬁcant fraction
of the indoor aersol in Santiago de Chile and Sao Paulo and, (b) that city-speciﬁc proﬁles of
major outdoor and indoor sources plus simultaneous measurements of chemical markers
outdoors and indoors can be used to apportion the major sources ofVOCTs and PM 2.5. Work
involves identifying and measuring city—speciﬁc source tracers in PM 2.5 and VOC’s, measuring
the tracers in outdoor and indoor air simultaneously and applying] developing a chemical mass
balance receptor-based air quality model to apportion outdoor air and indoor air source
contributions to indoor air quality. Ambient air measurements indoors and outdoors will be
made once in the morning and once in the aﬁernoon at four restaurant locations and four ofﬁce
locations divided equally as being near heavy trafﬁc and near a “park-like" setting in each city
(metropolitan area). Two additional outdoor measurements will be made on the sidewalk near
and away fonn trafﬁc to provide supplementary exposure data. The inclusion of four residences
in each city is proposed as an option. Up to ﬁfty constituents/tracers will be measured to include
metals, acids, Total VOC’s, individual VOC’s, and selected source-speciﬁc tracers. A
highlighted component of this work is the construction and deployment of an “advanced”
(source«term/residence-time) sampling system to acquire the samples.

The CIAR is requested to fund the indoor air component of ﬁns work. Outdoor air work will be
performed by collaborating institutions in Chile and Brazil using their own resources except for
the sampling system. Two systems will be constructed using CIAR support and one will be
provided to the collaborators along with training in its use.

Strengths and Weaknesses , A,

The opportunity to acquire source‘apportionment data and estimates of exposure in South
American countries is important for comparison with the extensive US. and European database.
The essentially no—cost participation of local collaborators expert in outdoor air quality is a
strength of the proposal. The principal investigators (and his host institutions) expertise in fuels
and energy-related source contributions is a ﬁirther strength. The principal weakness is an
inadequate description/justiﬁcation of many aspects of the study. It is not clear, for example,

extent of fatty streaks in part 1 was numerically smaller than in

We demonstrated that large airrlounts of blood
shift from the forearm veins during hy-pcrirentila-
lion (2). If this effect were géneralized in the
periphery of the body the volume of blood in the
creaSc in pressure in the central veins would be
evidence to support this suggestion. The fall in
peripheral venous pressure which occurs during
hyperventilation (2. 3), however, implies that
makes our thesis less attractive. Still, the trans.
mural pressure (4). the net pressure acting to dis-
tend the central veins, could t'ncrcate during over-
breathing if the pressure surrounding the veins
(intrapleural pressure) decreased more than did
the pressure within them.

This study was undertaken to assess the nature
and magnitude of changes in mean transmum!
central venous pressure during hyperventilation
with our suggestion that blood shifts centrally

during overbreathing.

ABSTRACT The mb-I gene is expressed only during the
early stages of B-Iymphocyte differentiation. Here we show that
the "lb-1 proximal promoter region contains a functionally
DNA-binding proteins. We found that both the E26 virus-
encoded v-ets and the myeloid/B-cell-specliic factor PU. l hind
efficiently to this site in via-o. By contrast, Ets- , the lympho-
ubiquitously expressed Ets-Z protein interacted weakly with
this binding site. DNA binding by both Ets-l and Ets-Z,
as 16 carboxyI-terminal amino acids. The inhibitory carboxyl-
terminal amino acid sequence is highly conserved between
Ets-l and Ets-2 but is not present in either v—ets or PU.1.
Replacement of the carboxyl-terminal amino acids of v-ets with
thm of Eur-1 decreased DNA binding by v-ets drastically.
Cotrapslatlon of Ets-l transcripts encoding proteins of differ-
ent lengths suggested that Ets-l binds DNA as a monomer.
Therefore, the carboxyl-terminal inhibitory domain appears to
interfere directly with DNA binding and not with homodimer-
tuition. Finally, the functional relevance of ETS factor binding
to the nib-l promoter site was evidenced by the stimulation of
ti'acscription through this site by a v-myb—v-ets fusion protein.
Together, these data suggest that one or more ETS family
factors are involved in the regulation of mb-I gene expression.


The B-lymphocyte—speciﬁc nib-1 gene is a model for the
regulation of lineage- and stage-speciﬁc gene expression. The
mb-I gene encodes a 32-kDa protein that is required for the
expression of IgM molecules on the B-cell surface (for
review, see ref. 1). Speciﬁc mb-l transcripts have been found
only in cells that comprise the early stages of B-lymphoid-celi
suggested that proximal mb—I promoter sequences residing
between nucleotides —68 to +70 contain sufficient informa-
linker scanning and deletion mutations across this region
indicated the importance of at least two distinct nuclear
factor-binding sites for mb—I promoterfunction (3). Both sites
were shown to interact with ubiquitous factors in virro. One
factor was identiﬁed as Spl, whereas the identity of the
second factor, termed MUF2 (mb-l upstream factor 2), is
unknown. Interestingly, the MUF2 site is identical to a
sequence within the polyornavirus enhancer region (PEA3
site) that is’ recognized by the nuclear DNA-binding protein
Hts-1 in vitro (4). Ets-l, which is expressed primarily in
lymphoid tissues, has been implicated as a tissue-speciﬁc
regulator of transcription (for review, see ref. 5). Therefore,
the question arises as to whether Ets-l or another lymphoid-

speciﬁc factor can bind the MUF2 site and participate in the
regulation of mb—l gene expression.

The ETS family of nuclear proteins is characterized by a
conserved DNA-binding motif referred to as the ETS domain
(6). Two members of the ETS family, the B- and T-cell-
speciﬁc Ets—l and myeloid/B—cell-speciﬁc PU.1 proteins, are
expressed in a cell-type-speciﬁc manner that suggests a role
in the regulation of lymphoid-speciﬁc genes (7-11). By con-
trast, Ets—Z, which is closely related to Ets-l, is expressed in
a wide range of tissue types and cultured cells (8, 9, 12). The
v-ets polypeptide is encoded by a transduced c-eIr-I gene
expressed by the avian retrovirus E26 as part of a tripartite
fusion protein. plil53“9"""""‘s (13, 14).

Here we report that Ets-l and PU.1 bind the mb-I promoter
in vitro, although with different efficiencies. We show that
this differential DNA binding is governed by the presence of
which are absent in PU.1 or v—ets.

Chromosome Rearrangements and DNA Repair
George Weinstock, Ph.D.

Summary

Research in my laboratory has been concerned with DNA repair and
recombination. For the past several years we have been studying unequal crossing
over (UCO) or ectopic recombination. UCO is the recombination that occurs
between repeated sequences that align out of register with the rest of the
such as duplications, deletions, inversions and translocations. Moreover, UCO is
stimulated by DNA damage. The purpose of the proposed research is to:

1 Continue studies in E. coli to understand the mechanism of UCO and develop
an assay for UCO that will allow us to investigate this phenomena in all
organisms.
2. Use this assay to investigate UCO in eukaryotic cells and determine the effect of
DNA damaging treatments, DNA repair systems, ageing, and other factors.

Background

UCO is recombination between repeated sequences that gives rise to
duplications, deletions, inversions, and chromosome translocations. In man these
types of rearrangements are associated with a variety of diseases. On the X
chromosome alone, examples of diseases resulting from rearrangements causing
deletions are Kallmann syndrome, Aicardi syndrome, Goltz syndrome, X-linked
xeroderma pigmentosum. An example of a duplication and a deletion that occur
between the same repeated sequences is Charcot—Marie—Tooth disease, caused by the
duplication, and HNPP syndrome, in which case the same region is deleted. There
are, of course, other examples of less severe diseases that are caused by
rearrangements on the X chromosome, perhaps most notable being the variations
in color vision caused by recombination between tandemly repeated opsin genes.
The effects on color discrimination point out another consequence of UCO; namely
that hybrid sequences are formed. In the case of color vision, recombination
between these slightly different opsin genes leads to new hybrid genes with altered
spectral sensitivities. In addition, numerous examples of rearrangements on the
other human chromosomes have been related to disease. It is anticipated that many
human disorders will be ultimately related to these types of chromosome
rearrangements. Thus, understanding the mechanism by which rearrangements
occur and developing more sensitive assays for detecting rearrangements is
important to the molecular medicine of the future.

Our laboratory has studied UCO in E. coli. Our use of this bacteria as a model
system was mainly prompted by its ease of genetic manipulation. However, UCO is
also important in bacterial pathogenesis. For example, Vibrz'o cholera amplifies the

an understanding of the hematologic pathobiology of the virus and the clinical management of patients with

by which HIV can cause disturbances in hematopoiesis: direct suppression of progenitor cell growth and

acid. This may explain the consistent lack of evidence for a direct effect on progenitor cells in in vivo studies
impaired. Though replication of the virus is, perhaps dogmatically, the yardstick by which a cell‘s tropism
for HIV is measured, it is possible that abortive infection of a cell that is not the usual target of the virus can
still alter the function of that cell. In this context, the marked suppression of progenitor cell growth in
vitro following infection by hepatitis B virus correlates with only a transient replication of the virus in
bone marrow cultures. We postulate, therefore, that while bone marrow progenitor cells or stroma cells
may not be the primary target cell of HIV in situ, abortive infection may still have negative consequences on

Our first aim is to determine whether the vpr gene of HIV is responsible for the suppression of
hematopoietic progenitor cells. The mouse embryonic stem cell (ES) is a totipotential cell line that has the
capacity to develop into every tissue type when injected into host blastocysts. As such, it has become a
model of hematopoiesis in these studies. Several characteristics of ES cells make it a good model to define the
role of vpr (and other regulatory genes) in stem cell suppression, and a good substitute for primary bone
marrow derived CD34+ cells whose use in similar studies may be technically more difficult. Since ES cells
are a pure population of truly totipotential cells, they can be used to gain insight into the biological
significance of novel genes, and dissect the molecular processes that occur during the early events of

techniques have been developed to study hematopoietic cell differentiation in ES cells, and the profile and
pattern of genes activated during this process have been characterized and are consistent and reproducible.
Thus, the expression of genes involved in the early stages of hematopoiesis precede those required for the
terminal stages of differentiation, Alterations in the normal process of differentiation is reflected in a
distorted profile of gene expression. These observations are relevant to the proposed study, Finally, based

Title: Nicotinic Receptors: Role in Secretion of Catccholamines from Chromaffin

Grant #: 4373

Reviewer: Pierce

Critique

This proposal appears to be a fine tuning of what is already known about the opening
of nicotinic aeetylcholine receptor channels resulting in non specific cation flow and
depolarization of cells. Calcium inﬂux is obligatory for the exocytotic fusion of
catecholaminevcontaining granules with the plasma membrane. The PI has found that
opening nicotinic catecholamine reactors by puff application of nicotine triggers exocytosis
which is regulated by calcium contributed from intracellular stores. There are 3 such pools:
an 1P3 sensitive store, a caffeine sensitive store and an IP3-and caffeine-sensitive store. She
noticed that the exocytotic response to standard depolarizing voltage pulses that open calcium
channels was potentiated after the cell had been exposed to nicotine This potentiation did
not require extracellular calcium, persists for 10 minutes and again, she believes that the
mechanism may include activation of specific intracellular stores. Similar potentiation of
depolarization-induced secretion was observed when cells were exposed to thapsigargin which
elevates calcium in bovine chromaffin cells. The PI is proficient in patch clamping and with
her associate, Dr. Formina, has studied the effect of nicotine on depolarized evoked secretion
and she postulates that the mechanism may involve speciﬁc intracellular calcium stores. She
will use a perforated patch mode to study secretion in the absence of cell dialysis which
allows enough time for the slow run down observed in whole cells, which will enable her to
calcium stores, and then study the reactions in the presence of nicotine. She will also
determine which second messenger systems participate in nicotine triggered secretion.

The experiment seems logical and are in the hands of a person capable of carrying
them out. I am ambivalent about these experiments and would recommend a priority of
about 1.8 but could be moved in either direction by Dr. Sabatini.

1) $309513 of Current Research:
There are many drugs of abuse, each of which has a distinctive pharmacology. For example,

stimulant drugs (e.g., amphetamine and caffeine) and depressant drugs (e.g., alcohol and
demonstrated in animal studies that certain brain areas play relatively more important roles in the
development and maintenance of behaviors related to the rewarding properties of drugs of abuse.
Two important pathways are the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine pathways, which emerge
from the ventral tegmental area of Tsai (VT A). Projection of the neurons of the VTA to the nucleus
accumbens (mesolimbic) and to the prefrontal cortex (mesocortical) appear to be important for the
increase neurotransmission through the mesolimbic-mesocortical sytems, eitherby increasing activity
of VTA neurons (e.g., nicotine, opiates, ethanol) or by augmenting the release of dopamine in the
terminal areas (e.g., cocaine and amphetamine). Because the VTA is one important area for the
mediation of drug-induced reward, the study of how various abused substances affect neurons of
the VTA is a critical for the treatment of addiction.

The overall goal of my research is to develop a better understanding of the physiology and
pharmacology of central reward systems. In order to approach this goal, I have developed a brain
slice preparation of the VTA suitable for intra- and extracellular recording. Putative dopamine~
containing neurons of the mesencephalon have been well characterized electrophysiologically lit
v_iy9; neurons in the brain slice appear similar to neurons studied in vivo. VTA neurons fire
spontaneouslyin a slow (0.5 - 5 Hz), regular pattern. We have examined the effects of several drugs
of abuse on this spontaneous activity. Among the agents we have examined are cocaine (Brodie
and Dunwiddie, 1990) and ethyl alcohol (Brodie, et al., 1990). We are continuing our study of
ethanol, by using intracellular recording in an attempt to determine the mechanism of action of
ethanol-induced excitation of VTA neurons. Ethanol appears to cause a slight depolarization, a
decrease in the action potential amplitude, and a decrease in the amplitude of the
whether any of these effects underlies the ethanol-induced excitation of VTA neurons.

We have also investigated the effects of nicotine on the spontaneous activity of VTA neurons
GBrodie, 1991). Nicotine excites VTA neurons in a concenu’ation-dependent manner. VTA neurons
possess an EC50 for nicotine-induced excitation of about 250 nM; therefore, VTA neurons are more
sensitive to the excitatory effects of nicotine than many other central neurons. Furthermore, little
desensitization to the effects of nicotine are seen at lower concentrations (less than 1 pM) (Brodie,
1991). The response of VTA neurons to nicotine is blocked by hexamethonium or mecamylamine.
VTA neurons also possess pirenzepine-sensitive muscarinic cholinergic receptors (Brodie and
Mueller, 1988; Lacey, et a1, 1988), so studies of nicotinic cholinergic receptors must be performed
with speciﬁc nicotinic agonists, and/or in the presence of muscarinic cholinergic antagonists. With
which would permit a more precise characterization of the speciﬁc receptor subtype involved in
mediating nicotine-induced excitation of VTA neurons.

2) Research Plan and Goals of Proposed Research
Molecular biologists have identified a number of different subtypes of the nicotinic

cholinergic receptor. It is known that the nicotinic cholinergic receptor is a pentamer formed from
4 subunits: 2 a subunits, and one each of B, y (or a) and 6. Recent studies from a number of
laboratories indicate that pharmacological specificity is conferred by the at and [5 subunits. Five
forms of the a subunit («2 - a6) and four forms of the [1 subunit (p2 - [15) are found in rat brain.
Different combinations of the various forms of these subunits constitute functionally different

Molecular characterization of the signal for radiation-inducible genes and the isolation of
novel radiation-inducible genes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae:

Michael Fasullo, PhD. Loyola University

Specific Aims:

Damage-inducible (DIN) genes have been cloned and characterized from many
organisims, including yeast, bacteria, and man. Many of these genes are induced by a variety
of DNA damaging agents that inﬂict a diverse spectrum of DNA lesions, including base pair
damage, cross-links, bulky adducts, and single- and double-strand breaks. These DNA
damaging agents include chemicals that cause oxidative damage via the formation of free
radicals, similar to those found in tobacco smoke. The diversity of DNA lesions caused by
free radicals provokes the question of whether all these lesions can serve as the primary
signal for damage—induction or whether these lesions are processed to a common signal that
triggers the induction of DIN genes. The aim of this project is to focus specifically at
ionizing radiation as an agent that induces DIN genes in yeast, to elucidate the genetic
such genes, and to isolate novel radiation-inducible genes that may be triggered directly by
the presence of DNA double—strand breaks. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been
chosen for these experiments becuase many genes involved in the repair of radiation damage
are well defined and the molecular biology and genetics to address the phenotypes of
been characterized as damage-inducible, and previous attempts to isolate DIN genes have
not utilized ionizing radiation as the DNA damaging agent.-

Significance:

Human genes that are induced by ionizing radiation include TNFa, p53 , protein
kinase C, IL-1, collagenase and gadd45 (growth grrest and QNAgamage). These and other
characterized genes represent a subset of a theoretically much larger set of genes (for review
see Fornace, 1992). Although the functional significance of the DIN genes has yet to be
explained, recent evidence has found that failure to induce gadd45 is correlated with
radiosensitivity in patients afﬂicted with Ataxia telangiectasia, and such patients have a
higher incidence of cancer, especially lymphomas. The induction of these genes by ionizing
Oxidative damage to membranes may trigger the expression of protein kinase C which
phophorylates transcription factors, such as jun, that in turn induce the expression of such
genes (Hallahan et al., 1991), although this may not be the mechanism of the induction of
gadd45. Alternatively, DNA damage may be the primary signal for the induction of damage-
inducible genes. This is suggested by the observation that cell lines that are defective in
damage repair have higher levels of the expression of particular damage-inducible genes
(Herrlich et al., 1992). Nonetheless, the signal transduction mechanism which is provoked
by a DNA lesion is poorly understood.

Elucidation of the pathway by which radiation-induced DNA lesions directly stimulate
DIN genes may be better addressed in yeast. This proposal is divided into the following
sections. First, elucidation of the mechanism by which a single double-strand break can

ABSTRACT The retroviral oncogene gin codes for a pro-
tein that belongs to the family of the winged helix transcrip-
tion factors. The viral Qin protein. v-Qin. differs front its
‘ellular counterpart. c«Qin. by functioning as a stronger
important in tuntorigenesis. To test this possibility. chimeric
proteins were constructed in which the Oil DNA~binding
domain was fused to either a strong repreasor domain (derived
from the Dmnplu‘ln Engrailed protein) or a strong activator
domain (from the herpes simplex virus W16 protein). The
chimeric transcriptional repressor. Qin—Engrailed. trans-
formed chicken embryo fibroblasts in culture and induced
VPlo. failed to transform cells in vitro or in vivo and caused
data support the conclusion that the Qin protein induces
oncogenic transformation by repressing the transcription of
genes which function as negative growth regulators or tumor
suppressors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Plasmid Construction. To create Qin-Engrailed (En) chi-
meras. the PCR-amplified fragments of mgrmlcd (ammo acids
2-298) (12) and v-qm (amino acids l-ZSI l (3) or chicken c-qm
(amino acids l-243) (i) value cloned consecutively into the
Hdell-Xbal or BamHl-Hmdlil sites of the same pBK/RSV
PCR included Banii-ii. Hindlll. and anI restriction sites
allowing in-frame cloning. All DNA fragments derived from
PCR ampliﬁcation were sequenced using primers internal to
Oin-VPl6 chimeras were constructed by exchanging an Expl—
fragment of plasmid 597.1 coding for thc transacuvation
domain of the VPlb protein (13). The coheswe ends generated
by Bani-ll or Espl digestion were filled in with Klenow
polymerase. The resultant Oin-VP16 and Oin-En plasmids
were cleaved with either BomHl-EcoRl or BamHl-Clal for
yield RCAS-Oin-En and RCAS-Oin-VPlo. Transfection of
chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) with the RCAS vectors
leads to the production of infectious RCAS retrovrruses that
replicate and express the cloned insert. The recrprocal recom-
binants between worn and c-qui. VC and CV. have been
described (2).

Electrophoretic Mobillty Shift Assays. Circular pBK/ RSV
plates form ruro translation in a transcription and translation
coupled system according to the manufacturer‘s protocol
(Promcga). Wheat germ lysates containing translated proreins
were used in electrophorctic mobility shift assays as described
(2). The relative amounts of translated proteins were estimated
by labeling the proteins with [“Slmethiomnc (40 uCi in 50 ul
autoradiography.
Transfection and Focus Assays. Assays for transcriptional
regulation in CEF cultures were carried tiul using transient

binding of preformed hormone—receptor complex to DNA. It
was not clear, however, whether sulfhydryl reagents block the
activation of glucocorticoid receptor-complex or its subse-
quent binding to nuclear receptor sites. Although some un—
derstanding has been achieved concerning the phenomenon
of temperature-dependent activation of rat liver glucocorti-

activation is not yet known (6—10). The present paper reports
evidence suggesting that sulfhydryl reagents block the acti~

its subsequent binding in nuclear acceptor sites.

LONG—PATH INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY FOR AIR
POLLUTION RESEARCH

E. R. STEPHENS"

Franklin Institute Laboratories, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

(Received 30 September 1960)

Abstract—Two long-path absorption cells have been designed and built for the measurement
of gaseous contaminants in the atmosphere and for the laboratory study of reactions occurring
in such atmospheres. These instruments are based on the White multiple-reﬂection system,

of the same radius at the other end.
To avoid excessive losses of radiant energy, the image of the infrared source is magniﬁed and

demagniﬁed to match the cell to the spectrometer. Optimum path for maximum absorption
signal is reached when reﬂection losses reduce the energy to l/e of its initial value. This cor-
responds to a path length of 120 m with the present cells although they have been successfully
of importance in air pollution at concentrations of a few tenths of a part per million. The
absorptions of water vapor and carbon dioxide make some regions of the spectrum opaque,

but this interference is not serious over most of the spectrum.
The ﬁrst of these cells was used for laboratory studies in Philadelphia and the second was
mounted in a laboratory trailer and taken to southern California where it has been in use

since 1956 for the study of the atmosphere and related problems.

O.\'E of the most serious problems encountered in air pollution research is that of obtaining
adequate analytical methods. Often one must try to analyze a complex mixture whose
composition can only be guessed and in which the components of interest are present in
very minute amounts. Chemical methods applied to such a problem suffer from the short-
coming that serious interferences may be caused by components whose presence is not only
unknown but unsuspected. An example of this is the potassium iodide method used to
measure "oxidant” in the Los Angeles atmosphere. Although most of the so-called “oxi-
dant” is believed to be ozone, the question of how much of it might be other oxidizing
agents is Still unresolved.

To meet the need for more speciﬁc analytical methods for the many substances of interest
in air pollution. the Franklin Institute Laboratories have been developing the technique of
long-path infrared absorption spectroscopy.

The primary interest in this work, which is sponsored by the Smoke and Fumes Com-
mittee of the American Petroleum Institute, has always been the chemistry of air pollution
rather than optics. spectroscopy, or analytical methods per 56. For this reason, previous
publications (1—4) have emphasized the results of reaction studies and described only
superﬁcially the instrumentation used. This paper is written in the belief that more details

of the long-path infrared technique may be of interest.

From the pathological aspect, areas of epithalisl
metaplasia in the lungs have been ﬂatly interpreted
by a minority group of pathologists as being pre-
cancerous areas signiﬁutntly associated with smoking.

However, similar lesions have been found in infants,

no satisfactory answer, if smoking does cause lung

in nonsmokers, it has also been shown that this is

Nonstructural Protein N82 of Parvovirus H-1 13 Required for Efficient Viral Protein

Synthesis and Virus Production in Rat Cells in Villa and in Vitro'

We generated a mutation in the gene for the nonstructural protein N82 of pervovlrus H-l in which the highly
conserved dlnucleotlde AG at the 3' splice acceptor site 01 N32 intron 1 was mutated to CG. The mutation does not
change the amino acid sequence for N81. The splice acceptor (SA) mutant gene was introduced into the Hit virus
(H-tSA) and an infectious clone of Lulll (pLthSA). The R2 tmnscripts encoding N82 were absent by both Northern
blot and primer extension analysis in the Lth SA or PM SA virus-infected cells and the N82 protein was undetectable
in the inlected cell Iysete by immunoprecipitetion. These N52 null mutant viruses were capable of lytlc growth in cell
lines that were derived from human. hamster. and dog. but they produced lower virus titers than wr1d~type 14-1. The
H-1SA virus nonproductively infected Reta rat ﬁbroblasts and transformed Rat? cell lines: Analysis oi synchronized
infections of rat ﬁbroblasts demonstrated that H»1SA viral duplex replicative form DNA replication was reduced and
that single-stranded progeny DNA was deﬁcient compared to wild-type H-1.1n addition. H-lSA viral protein synthesis
was about 10% of wild-type virus and Vlrlons were not detectable in rat ﬁbroblasts. However. H-lSA mRNAe R1 and R3
accumulated to wild-type levels. N82 was also required for productive infection in newborn rats but not in newborn
hamsters. These results indicate that N82 plays an important role in the regulation of viral protein synthesis in rat cells

INTRODUCTION

Autonomous parvoviruses contain a linear, single-
stranded (SS) DNA genome of about 5 kb. The geno-
mic organization has been found to be identical among
two overlapping transcription units; the early promoter.
P4. at the left-hand end or the viral genome produces
structural proteins N81 and N82. respectively. and the
late promoter. P38. generates the R3 transcripts which

N51 protein is coded for by a single exon and is
predicted by the sequence to have a molecular weight
of 76 kDa. However. NSt migrates as several 84- to
823ka3 bands on polyacrylamide gels. The slower mo-
bility oi the 88-kDa form of N81 is due to phosphoryla—

Expression, cytoskeletal utilization and dimer formation
of tropomyosin derived from retroviral-mediated cDNA transfer

. Expression of the tropomyosin-1 isofonn was enhanced by cDNA transfer in non-transformed
murine 3T3 ﬁbroblasts and also in v—Ki~ras transformed ﬁbroblasts in which native tropomyosin-1

expression had been reduced and tropomyosin-

2 synthesis virtually eliminated by action of the

formed transductants (3 -5 times normal levels). The high level of insert—derived tropomyosin-1
expression resulted in a considerable increase in tropomyosin-1 utilization in the cytoskeleton of
transformed cells, but this expression still did not reach normal levels, suggesting an oncogene-
related inhibition of tropomyosin utilization. A large proportion of newly synthesized native tropo—
myosin-1 in normal. unmodiﬁed ﬁbroblasts appeared in homodimers which, upon prolonged incuba-
tion, were largely converted to the heterodimers. Excess tropomyosiml derived from the inserted
cDNA also appeared largely as the homodimer in both normal and transformed cells. This homodi-
mer was utilized effectively in the formation of cytoskeletal structures but was partially converted

to heterodimer by chain exchange. Under steady
toskeletal tropomyosin—1-containing dimers were

—state conditions, approximately 33% of the cy-
homodimers, compared to approximately 10% in

normal ﬁbroblasts. The results show that the increased amount of tropomyosin-1 homodimer enter-
ing the cytoskeleton under conditions of tropomyosin-1 excess, results in an atypical microﬁlament
composition. The effect of this excess of tropomyosin-1 homodimers on stability or function of
microﬁlament ﬁbers remains to be determined. The results also conﬁrm that the mechanisms of

rapid homodimer formation with conversion to
vitro studies, also occur in vivo.

The synthesis of several microﬁlament—associated pro-
teins, including tropomyosin (Cooper et al., 1985), vinculin

clearly understood, and it is generally thought that they are
involved in stabilization of actin microﬁlaments which, in
turn, play an important role in maintaining cell shape, motil-

We recently reported that brain synaptosornes of newborn pigs
contained fewer FGEa (EP) and PGF,‘ (FF) receptors than adult
tissues. in the present study we investigated whether this was
of PGE2 andrPGFz. in the brain of newborn animals. Newborn
pigs (1-3 days old) were treated with ibuprofen (4D rag/kg) or
indomethacin (5 mglkg) i.v. every 4 hr for 24 hr to reduce
prostaglandins to adult levels. At the end of the treatment. EP
and FF receptor density and receptor-linked second messen-
found that ibuprofen and indomethacin treatment increased EP
and FF receptor densities in brain synaptosornes of newbom
animals to levels found in the adult; this up-reguiation of EP
receptors was prevented by EP receptor agonist. 16.16~di-

methyl-PGEz. and the up—regulation of FF receptors was pre-
agonist for El?z receptor subtype mediating cAMF stimulation)
and 11-deoxy-PGE, (an agonist for EP2 and E?3 receptors)
of ibuprofen-treated and adult animals. which was signiﬁ

and its analog. lenprostalene. caused a much greater increase
in IP3 production in brain synaptosornes ol ibuprofen-treated
than in vehicle-treated pigs. These ﬁndings suggest that the
relatively low EP and FF receptor densities in newborn pigs are
caused by the high levels of prostaglandins and that these

receptors can be up—regulated by inhibiting prostaglantﬁn syn-

Three specific platelet-derived growth factor
(PDGF) isoforms are thought to bind with differing
affinities to two distinct PDGF receptors which
undergo activation following dimerization. Recent evi-
dence has been presented that marked differences exist
between the ability of PDGF-AA versus PDGF-AB and
PDGF-BB to stimulate alterations in second messen-
gers in cultures of vascular smooth muscle cells
(VSMC), a result which was thought to be due to low
numbers of the A-type receptor in this cell type (Sach-
inidis, A., Locker, R., Vetter, W., Tatje, D., and Hoppe,
J. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 10238—10243, 1990). In
particular, PDGF-BB and PDGF-AB but not PDGF-
AA could elicit alterations in cytosolie free calcium
(C4122). However, because these studies were per-
formed on large cell populations using biochemical as-
says of PDGF activity, a minor PDGF-AA-Ca2+-re-
sponsive population of cells might go undetected. To
test this possibility, VSMC were isolated from either
thoracic or abdominal pig aorta, and alterations in
C232",- were monitored using Multiparameter Digitized
Video Microscopy following stimulation with PDGF
isoforms alone, or either before or after exposure of
VSMC to 5 mM EGTA. PDGF-AA-responsive cells were
found to exist only in cultures of thoracic VSMC,
caused oscillations in 082+“ represented 20% of the
sponsive to PDGF-BB. PDGF-BB elicited monophasic
alterations in Ca“,- in both thoracic and abdominal
VSMC. Prior addition of EGTA inhibited PDGF-AA
but not PDGF-BB-induced alterations in Caz’ﬁ. Addi-
tion of EGTA during PDGF-AA-induced Ca2+,- oscilla—
tions inhibited subsequent oscillations in Cazm while
addition of EGTA at the peak of the PDGF-BB Ca2+
response resulted in a more rapid return of Ca“.- to
prestimulation levels. These data suggest that regional
differences in the distribution of PDGF-A— and B—type
and B-type PDGF receptors results in distinct altera-
tions in 0322.

(mitogenesis, chemotaxis, and vasoconstriction) through the
existence of distinct PDGF isoforms and receptors (1—4).
Human PDGF consists of two disulﬁde-bonded homologous
peptide chains, A and B (PDGF-AB). Each chain is the
product of a distinct cellular gene, their expression being
independently regulated and the two chains sharing approxi-
mately 50% homology (5—7). Porcine PDGF appears to be a
BB homodimer as is PDGF isolated from most animal species
factor-stimulated ﬁbroblasts and a number of tumor cell lines

These different types of PDGF molecules are thought to
bind to at least two distinct types of PDGF receptors. The
originally described receptor (B-type, 180 kDa, similar to the
CSF-l receptor) was found to bind the B chain of PDGF, is
located on chromosome 5 and possesses tyrosine kinase activ-
ity (12). A second type of PDGF receptor (A-type, 170 kDa,
similar to the C-kit gene product) is thought to bind both
PDGF A and B chains, is located on chromosome 4, and also
contains tyrosine kinase activity (13). Since the receptors
display some selectivity in terms of which PDGF chains they
can bind, and because active PDGF molecules are thought to
proposed where PDGF binding to its receptors requires di-
merization of the A- and thype receptor subunits to elicit
functional activity (14—16). These models predict that dimer-
ization of two A-type receptors could lead to binding of all
three types of PDGF isoforms (AA, BB, AB), While dimeril
zation of two B-type receptors could only lead to binding of
PDGF-BB (although some data suggests that PDGF-AB can
bind to cells containing only the B-type receptor albeit at 10-
fold lower afﬁnity than PDGF~BB). A key aspect of these
models is that in cells lacking the A-type PDGF receptor,
there should be no response to either PDGF~AA or PDGF-
AB.

The mechanisms by which PDGF binding to its receptor is
transduced into biological activity are still unclear. Our lab-
oratory has been studying the role of PDGF-induced altera-

THE 1986 BERNARD B. BRODIE AWARD LECTURE

The Genetic Regulation of Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes

DANIEL W. NEBERT

Chief, Laboratory of Developmental Pharmacology, National Institute a! Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health

I feel very honored, indeed, and also very humble, to have the
privilege of joining my four esteemed colleagues (lv4) in being
named as recipient of the ﬁfth Bernard B. Brodie Award in Drug
Metabolism. I thank the American Society for Pharmacology
and Experimental Therapeutics (administrators of this award)
and the CIBA-GEIGY Corp. (sponsors of this award) for their
mctabolizing enzymes. My training began in the laboratories of
Howard S. Mason, and then Harry Gelboin, who both helped
me in choosing the direction of my future studies. I am thankful
for my association during the subsequent 18 years with numerous
talented colleagues and collaborators without whose skill, hard
work, creativity, and continued support and friendship the work
are several individuals whose contributions are not. One of these
is Ernst Caspari, in 1959 with The Department of Biology,
Wesleyan University, Middletown CT, who inspired me to think
that “there can be little sense to biology, except in the context of
genetics and evolution.“ Two others include Mort B. Lipsett,
previous Director of the National Institute of Child Health and
Human Development (NICHHD), and Arthur S. Levine, Sci-
entiﬁc Director of the NICHHD, who helped create the environ-
ment needed for the pursuit of innovative basic research, The
reviewed many of my publications since 1981, and who gave
birth to two beautiful, healthy twin boys the same day that John
Schenkman informed me of my being recipient of the Brodie
Award.

This paper is directed at the graduate student and beginning
postdoctoral fellow. I wish to illustrate the chain of events in my
career—how the thinking in my laboratory led to the design of
an experiment, and how our interpretation of new data led to
the next hypothesis. At each point in time, of course, develop»
ment of the next experiment was heavily inﬂuenced by the
prevalent thinking, the skill and creativity of my postdoctoral
fellows and collaborators, and the techniques available.

Genetic Locus Deﬁned. The metabolism of carcinogenic poly-
cyclic hydrocarbons, such as benzo[a]pyrene, was known 2 dec-
ades ago to be carried out by a P-450 enzyme, aryl hydrocarbon
hydroxylase (AHH).l We had found that it was possible to study
in cell culture the regulation of AHH activity—including induc-
tion by benzo[a]anthraoene, cycloheximide, and actinomycin D
(5—9). The induction, by polycyclic hydrocarbons, of an enzyme
that metabolized polycyclic hydrocarbons, seemed very exciting
because of its relevance to human environmentally caused cancer

This paper is dedicated to the memory ol Mort B. Lipsett (1921—1985). whose
enthusiastic support as a friend and administrator I shall never target.

and toxicity. The induction of an enzyme by many of its sub-
strates also appeared to be very important in fundamental studies

A survey of AHH inducibility among several inbred mouse
strains (l0) therefore “seemed like a neat idea" for several rea-
better to have a biologic mutant than not to have a biologic
mutant.” (ii) In 1969, carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and toxicity
were just beginning to be measurable in tissue culture. The intact
mouse thus promised to be a better model for the study of
pathophysiologic effects of environmental chemicals. (iii) The
observations of genetic differences in the mouse can most likely
be extrapolated to human disease caused by the metabolism of
several inbred mouse strains (10) revealed a fundamental differ-
Methylcholanthrene (MC) treatment increased hepatic AHH
activity more than 6-fold in B6 but not D2 mice. A 2-nm spectral
shift in the reduced P-450-C0 complex was also seen in MC-
treated 36 but not D2 mice. The B6-D2 difference was not
observed following phenobarbital treatment. One interpretation
might lead to the appearance, or large increase, of at least one
new P—450 protein; alternatively, MC might cause a decrease in
one or more other proteins, unmasking an already existing P-
450 protein in BG but not D2 mice. Why does the BG mouse,
when presented with a polycyclic hydorcarbon stimulus, respond
with an increase in polycyclic hydrocarbon metabolism while
the D2 mouse does not? The rest of my career to date has been
devoted to gaining a better understanding of this observation.

We ﬁrst wondered what would happen if the genetically “re-
sponsive” Bo mouse were crossed with the genetically “nonres-
ponsive” D2 mouse. The lack of AHH induction was found to
be inherited as a Mendelian autosomal recessive trait (l 1) [al-
though the inheritance of this trait appeared to be more compli-
cated when we studied crosses between other inbred mouse
strains (12)], Moreover, inheritance of this trait was found in

To provide the means for the identification and analysis of low
molecular weight syrup fragments in enzyme-hydrolyzed hydroxypropylated
starch.

SUMMARY:>

hydroxypropylated starch might be of commercial value. However, prior
to obtaining FDA approval for the sale of such material, a survey of
the low molecular weight fragments to DP4 would have been desired.
Penick & Ford requested an estimate of the effort that might be required
to obtain and develop the methods and information. Preliminary analyses
of typical syrups from Penick & Ford were made using gas chromatography (1)
and thin-layer chromatography (2). The results of this investigation. along
with recommendations for possible paths of approach, were furnished
Penick & Ford. Since then, the decision has been reached by them to

terminate this program.

MEMORANDUM:

Three samples of enzyme degraded hydroxypropyl starch syrups were
prepared by Mr. R. B. Nelson of Penick & Ford from propylene oxide-substituted
corn starch (3). These ranged in D.E. from 14.6 to 16.7%. The base starches
used in the production of these syrups ranged from 1.30 to 4.42% propylene
oxide substitution based on dry substance. The syrups were carbon treated,
ion-exchanged and concentrated to about 80% total solids prior to being

received by us.

Dr. Fenstermacher a professor of physiology and biophysics in
Stonybrook, New York, is interested in experiments on the rat t0‘
determine and relate local cerebral blood flow and correlate it with
local glucose utilization. He divided his goals in a whole series of
effect of nicotine on both cerebral blood flow and cerebral glucose
utilization. For that purpose two experimental series of rats will be
used, control and those with nicotine exposure. All methods are highly
indirect. For example, he will use quantitative autoradiography, in
which the optical density is related to the radioactivity from standard
data, he will use light microscopy in order to study morphometry. Blood
flow will be measured with 14C iodoantipyrine. He seems to believe
quite firmly in the idea that there is recruitment of blood vessels in
the brain, a fact which has never been verified by direct observations.
He also thinks that with this methodology he is able to determine volume
of perfused microvessels. Despite a multiplicity of specific aims and
hypotheses, it really boils down to a correlation between local blood
flow and local glucose utilization.

Since all methods are indirect, they are beset with a
difficulty of drawing conclusion which are very involved and difficult
to substantiate. For example, quantitative autoradiography, iodoanti-
pyrine measurement of surface area and permeability products all these

are highly speculative.

generally be met by its metabolic precursor homo
cysteine in the form of homocystine [I]. A similar
situation has been lound for primary cultures of
normal mammalian cells where either methionine

Human Coronavirus Receptors

Background and Significance

Coronaviruses are one of 14 RNA virus families that infect humans and a broad range
of domestic animal species. Some of the viruses appear to be zoonotic. They are a
medically important group of viruses exhibiting tropisms for the lung, intestine, liver,
brain, kidney, eye, heart, and peritoneum resulting primarily in respiratory,
gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and neurological diseases. In humans, they are known
to cause acute respiratory infections and gastroenteritis. However, they have been
implicated in association with acute lethal necrotizing enterocolites in children (Science
2292978, 1985), chronic enterocolites or Sprue (Dig. Dis.Sci. 2721039, 1982),
pericarditis (J. Med. Virol. 6:259, 1980) and multiple sclerosis (Science 2092933,
1980; Ann. Neurol. 31:525, 1992; Talbot et a1, Virol, in press). Two recent studies
show that a signiﬁcant sample of multiple sclerosis brain tissue was positive when
either speciﬁc probes or PCR were used to detect coronavirus nucleic acid (Ann.
Neurol. 312525, 1992; Talbot et a1, Virol., in press). This is particularly signiﬁcant
since coronaviruses infect humans and could possibly serve as a cofactor in such a
neurological disease. Recently a primate model was used to show that the primate CNS
is susceptible to infection with coronaviruses (Virol 1882274, 1992). It has been
clearly shown that coronaviruses can target to the brain of experimentally infected mice
(Perlman, et al., 1989, 1990). It seems reasonable to postulate that such may also
occur in humans during the course of a "normal respiratory infection" with these
viruses. It is well documented that coronaviruses can readily establish persistence in
both tissue culture and in the animal. This may apply to humans as well. Our
initial step in infection of the human respiratory tract by coronaviruses and allow us to
begin studies toward understanding how these viruses also infect the CNS.

Three receptors have been identiﬁed thus far for coronaviruses. The receptor for the
mouse hepatitis coronavirus—A59 (MHV-A59) is a member of the carcinoembryonic
antigen family. Aminopeptidase N, also known as CD13, was recently identiﬁed as the
(TGEV) (Nature 357:417; 420, 1992). All of these coronaviruses have two major
envelope proteins, the spike (S) and matrix (M). In all cases S interacts with the
receptor. Some coronaviruses have, in addition to the S and M, a third major envelope
protein, the hemagglutinin—esterase (HE). BCV, a bovine coronavirus, expresses HE
and this protein can use N—acetyl-9—O—acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2) as a receptor
determinant to initiate an infection (J. Gen. Virol. 73:901, 1992). The data from this
study suggests that a second receptor may be involved. The rece tor s for the hunm
coronavirus OC43 has not been identiﬁed. HCV—OC43 does bind Neu5,9Ac2 on
erythrocytes (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 85:4526); however, we do not know if this
is a receptor determinant on cells that are normally infected by this virus. Data from

Furs-2 ﬂuorescence in single rat basophilic leukemia
free ionized calcium ([Ca‘*];) produced by aggregation
increases in [Ca'“],- were induced by antigen stimula-
tion and were measured using digital video imaging
microscopy at high time resolution. The [Ca“].— oscil-
lations were not dependent upon changes in the mem-
brane potential of the cells and were observed in cells
stimulated with antigen either with or without extra-
cellular Ca“. Transient oscillations in We“), were also
observed when calcium inﬂux was blocked with La".
These results suggested that during antigen stimula-
tion of cells under normal physiological conditions,
release of Ca“ from intracellular stores makes an im-
portant contribution to the initial increase in [Ca2+]i.
[Caz‘], with the calcium ionophore ionomycin. Mito-
chondrial calcium buffering is not required for [0112*],-
oscillations to occur. The results show that rat basa-
philic leukemia cells have signiﬁcant stores of calcium
and that release of calcium from these stores can par-

ticipate in both the initial rise and the oscillations in
[Ca"].—.

a

Rat basophilic leukemia (RBLl‘ cells are a tumor mast cell
line that responds to stimuli that aggregate surface receptors
for immunoglobulin E (lgE), generating a large rise in intra-
cellular free ionized calcium ( [Ca2+],) and ultimately resulting
in secretion of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity. It
has long been known that Ca2+ plays a critical role in the

initiation and control of secretory behavior in many different

ionophores have established a causal relationship between the
increase in [CaH]. and secretion (1, 2). Changes in [Ca”]. in
RBL cells have largely been attributed to the inﬂux of Cat“
from the extracellular medium (3—6). However. the involve-
ment of releasable calcium stores in the control of cellular
processes has been documented in many cell types, and cal-
cium stores have recently been implicated in the generation
of elevated [03“]. in RBL cells2 (5, 7, 8). Indeed, stores are
sufﬁcient to supply enough calcium to support much of the
early phase of the rise in [0213’]. in these cells (5).

In this ‘study, we have begun to characterize the [Ca2+].-
oscillations, to identify their source, and to determine what
cellular components are involved in their control. We have
found that oscillations in [Cahh can still occur when the
membrane potential is clamped and do not require calcium
inﬂux from the extracellular solution. The [021“],- oscillations

appear to occur as the result of modulation of [Oak], by
exchange with intracellular stores.

Abstract. Proﬁlirt is a conserved. widely distributed
aetin monomer binding protein found in eukaryotic
cells. Mammalian profilin reversibly sequesters actin
monomers in a high afﬁnity proﬁlactin complex. In
vitro. the complex is dissociated in response to treat-
ment with the polyphosphoinositides. phosphatidylinoL
bisphosphate. Here. we demonstrate the ultrastructural

content is a Iz-ls—ItD cytoplasmic actin monomer
P binding protein of eukaryotic cells (Carlsson et al..
I976: Magdolen et aL. 1988: Reichstein and Korn.
I979). Mammalian proﬁ lin occurs as a single isotype (Annie
et al.. I988: Kwiagtltowski and Bruns, I988) and interacts
with actin monomers to sequester them from recruitment
into actin ﬁlaments. In Vitro. the aﬂ‘inity of mammaltan spleen
proﬁlin for skeletal muscle aetin monomer is relatively low.

The factorts) responsible for the high aﬂinity proﬁlactin
complex have not been identiﬁed (Larsson and Lindberg.
I988). The transient appearance of the high aﬂinity complex
Markey et al.. I98I) suggests that some mechanism exists in-
side cells for its rapid formation and dissociation. Lassing
and Lindberg (I985) have demonstrated that the high affinity
complex can be dissociated by treatment with the polyphos-
phoinositides. phosphatidylinositol monophosphate (PIPlJ

of proﬁlin is found associated with regions of cell
membrane devoid of actin ﬁlaments and other discern-
ible structures. After platelet activation. the membrane
association of profilin reversibly increases. This study
represents the ﬁrst direct evidence for an interaction
between proﬁlin and phospholipids in vivo.

complex

PIP and PIP: consist of an acidic. phosphorylated inositol
side group connected to .1 glycerol backbone to which two
long hydrophobic acyl chains are attached. They are. there-
and indeed are widely thought to be localized to the inner
leaﬂet of the plasma membrane (Garrett and Redman. I975;
Mauco et aI. . I987). The presence of multiple distinct meta-
bolic pools of PI? and PIP: in erythrocytes and platelets
(Billah and lapetina. I982: King et aI.. I987). suggests.
moreover. that some PIP and PIP~ are sequestered in the
plasma (and perhaps other intracellular) membranem. pos-
sibly due to binding to cytoplasmic proteins (Anderson and
Marchesi. 1985: Sheet: et al.. I982).

In support of an intracellular interaction between proﬁlin
and membrane-bound PIP and PIP,. here we provide direct
morphologic evidence for a close association of a large por-
tion of cellular pmﬁlin with membranes in both intact human

I. SALMONELLA/MICROSOME (S/M) MUTATION‘ASSAY -- MAINSTREAM AND

A S/M experiment was conducted to compare 2R1 sidestream
(SS), base fraction (BF), and neutral fraction (NF) from a small
scale smoking (2) (30 cigerettes smoked one at a time) to that
of a large scale smoking (3) (120 cigerettes smoked 30 at a time).
In TABS» results obtained for the small scale smoking compared
well with data from the large scale smoking and with previous
results using these same samples. Analysis of the data indicated
that the bulk of the activity resides in the BF with minimal
activity in NE. Data from TAIOﬂ‘also compared favorably with
previous data and between small and large scale smokings. While
analysis of the TAIOO data indicated no difference in SS CSC, BF
and? NF activities, the NF from the large scale smoking appeared
more active than that obtainedlﬁromithe small scale smoking.

The collaborative study to evaluate MS and SS CSCs, BFs, and
NFs from five cigarette types was completed. To follow up these
studies, an experiment was performed to examine the relationship
of duplicate SS CSCs, BFs, and NFs from all five cigarette codes
simultaneously. Examination‘of the data revealed a close agree—
ment with the previously reported data in that the BFs appeared
more active than CSCs while NFs possessed little activity. Plans
call for TAlOO‘to be similarly tested.

ong primates, including man. Visual

. d, particularly, auditory signals have

en studied in considerable detail in a

umber of species, but our knowledge of

Irimate chemical communication is still

latively poor.

The South American marmosets and

'nmarins are excellent models for the study

fchernical communication. Their very

mall body size and arboreal life style place
certain restrictions on the effectiveness

in scent marking. The subject of our

research, the saddle-back tamarin

undertaken long-term studies of the
c0mmunicatory content and chemical
Composition of these scent marks, along
With their role in some areas of social
behavior.

 

    

Our aim is to determine how
communicatory signals are encoded and
how they are interpreted by recipients. Our
studies have shown that the scent marks
contain a detailed communicatory code
which enables the recipient to obtain
important information on the scent donor.
The monkeys can discriminate between
their own scent and that of several other
callitrichid species and subspecies. Cues
for male-female discrimination, and
discrimination between castrated and
normal males, are also present. Moreover,
the monkeys discriminate between scents
from dominant and submissive males, and
between familiar male as well as female
individuals. The scent may also contain
cues which allow the tamarins to assess the
period of time that elapsed since the scent
mark was deposited. The interpretation of
such information is inﬂuenced by the social
context in which it is perceived, as well as
by the previous experiences of the
recipient. These factors, in turn, influence
the responses to the scent.

The scent marks are chemically
complex. The major volatile compounds
are squalene, cholesterol and a series of
butyrates. In addition, volatile compounds,
as well as a number of high molecular
important in determining the sensory
qualities of these highly complex “social
perfumes.”

Chemistry of Aphrodisin

Alan Singer
My research interest is the chemical
identiﬁcation of mammalian pheromones,
compounds that act via the chemical senses
to help regulate social interactions in a
population of mammals. An important
motivation for this research is the
expectation that identiﬁcation of such
compounds with a demonstrable and
biologically important function will lead
directly to advances in the understanding
of the chemical senses by providing useful
stimulus molecules for the study of
structure-activity relations and for the
investigation of peripheral chemoreceptor
mechanisms.

The approach is interdisciplinary,
collaborative, and it is based on the
classical technique of chemical
fractionation followed by biological assay,
a process that is repeated until pure active
compounds are isolated. These active
compounds are then characterized by
appropriate chemical and biochemical
techniques for the analysis of molecular
structure.
One result of this work has been
the isolation and characterization of
aphrodisin, a protein produced by female
hamsters that acts on vomeronasal
chemoreceptors to elicit sexual behavior
from males. The structure of this protein
shows that it is a member of a superfamily
of extracellular proteins secreted by glands
in numerous animal species, and most
closely related to the recently described
odorant-binding protein. Experiments on
the behavioral and physiological activity
of “synthetic” aphrodisin (produced by
molecular cloning in bacteria) have already
demonstrated that identiﬁcation of
authentic mammalian pheromones will
lead to signiﬁcant advances in research on

2.2. Measurement and estimation of smoke
dosage to non—smokers from environmental
tobacco smoke
INTRODUCTION

Recent increased public awareness and con-
cern about environmental tobacco smoke
(ETS) has derived from a number of epidem-
iological studies which have suggested signiﬁ-

cant risks to the health of the exposed non—

smoker. Some studies have found that young
children with smoking parents have an
increased risk of bronchitis and pneumonia,
especially in the ﬁrst year of life (1, 2). Adults
chronically exposed to ETS have been reported
to have impaired lung function (3) and an
increased risk of lung cancer (4—6). The issue
to say that the reality of the risks is not as yet
generally accepted by the scientiﬁc commu-
nity. One of the weaknesses of the studies so far
performed is that they have not attempted to
quantify the actual dose of ETS received by the
non-smoker, although, as one critic has argued,
this is fundamental to evaluation of the evi—
dence (10).

Epidemiological investigation of the risks of
ETS exposure would beneﬁt from both a reli-
able non-invasive marker and a validated ques—
tionnaire for assessing the degree of exposure.
While blood carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) has
been found to be of use in short-term studies, it

is not speciﬁc to tobacco smoke and may not be
sufﬁciently sensitive to reflect the totality of
exposure across the whole range of situations
occurring in daily life. Thiocyanate (SCN) may
likewise suffer from a lack of speciﬁcity and
sensitivity. Nicotine is speciﬁc to tobacco but
has a short half life in plasma, and its major
metabolite, cotinine, may provide a better
guide.

The present paper addresses several issues
on estimating the human dose of ETS. In the
ﬁrst section we present data relating to the
validity of self-reports of ETS exposure and to
the choice of biochemical marker for use in
epidemiological surveys. We then document
the smoke dose received from a short-term
this to blood and urinary nicotine levels
resulting from slow intravenous infusion of
to reach some conclusions about the dose
from smoking. These studies will be published
in greater detail elsewhere.

INTRODUCTION

To date the best characterized receptorchannel complex is the
muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR). Several studies
demonstrate that muscle AChRs are subject to various forms of
regulation. Distinct changes in channel properties, receptor distribution
and subunit composition are observed over the course of development.
Also, acute changes in the degree of receptor phosphorylation induce a
functional change in the rate of receptor desensitization (for a review,
regulation provide an important intellectual framework for studies of
other ligand-gated channels in the central and peripheral nervous

Initial studies of neuronal nicotinic ACh receptors suggest that
there may be structural, pharmacological, and functional differences
interested in two related problems pertinent to nicotinic AChR function:
(1) how neuronal nicotinic receptors of the chick sympathetic ganglion
neurons are regulated during development and following synapse
formation and (2) how AChR function may be subsequently modulated

by another transmitter present in these ganglia, the peptide substance P
(SP).

The words “subclinical picture" might be more

produced by the hepatitis A virus is not clinically
apparent. They suggest it is this sporadic. inapparent
infection that maintains the hepatitis A virus in

Recently in New York City. in urological testing of
more than 1.000 specimens. this research team found
antibodies to hepatitis A virus in 01% of middle class
volunteer blood donors and in 609‘. oi poor persons
from the inner city. Despite this prevalence. less than
592 of these people could remember having had hepa-
titis. The investigators say this is "consistent With the
belief that most cases are clinically inapparent "

Even when hepatitis A is clinically apparent. Dr

audience in Boston. usually it is a mild. self-limited
illness. Hepatic encephalopathy develops in a [eu-

colleagues have studied. all patients have survived
Thus. he said. evidence trout these and other studies
suggests that hepatitis A rarely tulminates. and the
virus so far has not been associated ser'ologically with
chronic liver disease.
Until recently. he says. most of what was known
about the epidemiology of hepatitis A was learned

With regard to age. the prevalence of antibodies to
hepatitis A virus increases with age in all socioeco-
nomic groups tested. approaching 80?: among persons
50 or older. It is possible that these older people were
exposed to the virus years ago when living conditions
were less hygienic. Support for this idea is found in
the declining number of reported childhood cases of

people of a higher socioeconomic class live. serological

of these seroepidemiologic studies is the advisability
of preparing immune serum globulin from plasma of

several investigators and holds "whether social—m.

Right ventricles removed from laboratory rats would be isolated in a

recovery of function assessed.

In addition to being recorded on the Grass recorder, the wave form of the

Packard Oscilliscope-camera system. In this manner the onset and decline of
developed tension, the latency period between stimulus and contraction, and the

resting tension during the pre-CO, the CO and recovery from CD periods will be

compared.
The information obtained in this functional analysis would then be used as

Cigarette Smoke, Beta—Carotene, Alcohol and Cancer

BACKGROUND and PLAN: Pryor is a "living legend" in the world of reactive oxidant
species, particularly those involving free radicals and/or cigarette smoke. For many years, he has
been a proponent of the theory that some low molecular weight water soluble quinone system
radicals in cigarette smoke are responsible for DNA damage, speciﬁcally production of single
strand breaks. Since his tar extract system produces superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl
radicals, the mechanism, along with the identity of the radical remains obscure.

trial) and the ATBC (alpha-tocopherol-beta—carotene for cancer prevention) study in which it was
revealed that smokers had suffered higher rates of lung cancer with beta—carotene
supplementation. This was confounded by the finding that in fact alcohol intake more clearly
beta—carotene in the CARET study, cigarette smoke might actually be interacting with that
molecule to generate oxidizing tumor promoters. Pryor believes he is in a unique position to help
unravel this birdsnest of interacting variables. He proposes ﬁve lines of inquiry:
1. Does the aforementioned radical actually cause single strand breaks in DNA? In fact he
has already shown that it does albeit at a tremendously high level of the tar extract.

2. Does his quinone model compound bind to DNA? His model system for these studies is
an aged catechol solution which he has now prepared with carbon—l4. He will ascertain its DNA
binding ability.

3. Does BaP bind to DNA in the presence of tar extract but not microsomes? Does BaP
bind to DNA in the presence of microsomes with or without tar extract? Does the binding differ if
normal or ethanol-induced microsomes are used? When binding occurs, what are the effects of
beta—carotene and alpha tocopherol? He has in fact already demonstrated BaP binding, but it is in
the presence of cigarette tar levels of up to 50:1 weight to weight excess over the DNA target,

Can this be meaningful in any physiological sense?

4. Do the micronutrients beta-carotene or alpha—tocopherol bind to DNA in the presence of
microsomes and/or cigarette tar extract? Does the presence of BaP inﬂuence the binding of these
micronutrients to DNA? With this series of experrnents‘ he hopes to test the hypothesis that
carotenes may react with the radicals and/or oxidants to form species that can add to DNA to give
an adtluct that will then affect the subsequent. binding of BaP. This is another kitchen sink series
of experiments that could take tremendous amounts of time and when the results are extrapolated

5, Do BaP DNA-adducts form in rat hepatocytes exposed to ACT? Are there differences
effect of beta—carotene or alpha—tecopherol? This is actually one of the more interesting questions
that he wants to address and may in fact relate directly to the ethanol ﬁnding in the ATBC study.

Changes in Smoking Characteristics by Type of
Employment From 1970 to 1979/80
{at 2W"

James J. weinkam, DSc, and Theodor D. Sterling, PhD

 

Changes in the distribution of smoking status between and within occupations by sex.
race, and age are examined for 1970 and 1979/30, 10 years that saw rapid changes in
smoking prevalence. The pattern of econpation within smoking categories remains
basically unchanged, and, in fact, becomes more pronounced among males. The proba»
bility of young people taking up smoking remains tied to eventual occupational choice.
The decline in smoking prevalence is larger among the employed than among those who

are not employed. There has been a substantial increase in refusals to answer questions
about smoking.

Key words: occupation, smoking prevalence, smoking decline

 

INTRODUCTION

There have been a number of reports on prevalence of smoking by occupation.
based largely on data collected prior to 1971 [Sterling and Weinkam, 1976, 1978;
Covey and Wynder, 1981; Blair et al, 1985]. However, profound changes have taken
place since then that may have affected both the mix of occupations and the prevalence
of smoking of the U.S. population. Widespread introduction of new technology may
have operated to lessen the importance of certain service jobs and to increase
technical, professional, and clerical employment. These same factors may also have
contributed to a shift in racial differences in occupation. Housewives have entered or
reentcred the labor force in increasing numbers. At the same time, there appears to
have been an overall decline in the prevalence of smoking.

Changes in smoking prevalence over time raise a number of questions of
importance to occupational health investigations:

1. Have ’hcre been changes in the occupational differences in smoking
prevalence?

2. Have there been changes in the distribution of occupations within various
smoking categories?

3. Are such changes similar for females and males, for blacks and whites?

Principal Investigator: Thomas Smithgall

Title: Regulation of ras signaling by the c-fes proto-oncogene
tyrosine kinase

Critique: The applicant has shown that c-fes, which is proposed to
be linked to GM-CSF, interleukin 3 and erythropoietin receptor
signaling pathways has been shown to cause myeloid cell
differentiation and to block GM—CSF-mediated cell proliferation.
The applicant proposes that the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase c-fes
exerts its antigrowth and differentiating effects by opposing the
major growth pathway involving activated ras. The applicant has
clearly identified a very important question, because it is clear
that tyrosine kinases are involved in differentiation as well as in
proliferation. The strengths of this proposal are several:
Firstly, the importance of the question addressed; secondly, the
extensive background work carried out by the principal
fellowship and in publications and preliminary data obtained as an
independent investigator, thirdly, the use of straightforward,
readily interpretable assays focusing on the effect of c-fes on GAP
activity: and fourthly, broader considerations of the effects of c-
fes involving other components of the mitogenic signaling cascades
such as fos, she, and vav.

The Principal Investigator received his Ph.D. in 1986 in
pharmacology from the University of Pennsylvania where he studied
steroid metabolizing enzymes involved in carcinogen metabolism.
His postdoctoral fellowship at the National Institutes of Health
began his work on tyrosine kinases and specifically c—fes, its
biological activity and interaction with GAP. He has a very strong
publication record with important studies published in highly
refereed and quality journals, such as Biochemistry and The Journal
of Biological Chemistry. He became an Assistant Professor at the
Eppley Institute in 1991. He presently has National Institutes of
Health and American Cancer Society support, the latter for salary.
Budget should be reduced to a bingle.

Resume: This is an excellent proposal by a young assistant
professor to study the molecular mechanisms through which the
tyrosine kinase c—fes induces cell differentiation. The excellent
publication record, the importance of the question and the focused
nature of the studies make this an outstanding proposal. In this
application, as in several others reviewed, the applicant requests
uses the same tools as that of an NIH grant that is on-going. I
would suggest discussion of the generic problem of individuals
submitting multiple grants to study a single question with one
grant being sent in for each small aspect of the general question
and hypothesis, i.e., none of these represent distinct lines of
inquiry. Recommend approval at a scientific priority of 1.2.

Standard response in the range of 100 to 2200 ng/ul was
linear. Lower limit of detection under current analytical
practices is m20 ng/ul. The RL sheet generated will be made
into cigarettes to determine dust generation from RL as well
as possible transfer of propyl paraben to non—RL blend

components.

We are currently working with Ms. E. T. Oakley in developing
a procedure for estimating oriental tobacco in cigarettes.
The methyl ester of B-methylvaleric acid is used as the
marker for oriental. Contributions from bright and burley
tobaccos appear to be minimal (<10 ug/g versus N950 ug/g for
oriental).

Preliminary results with synthetic Marlboro blends show good
correlations, but B—methylvaleric acid concentration ranges in
various grades of oriental from different countries need to be
determined.

A procedure is being developed for determining C2-C6 volatile
fatty acids in tobacco and filler. Although we were not
successful with butyl ester derivatives because of dilution
problems, benzyl ester derivatization shows promise. This
procedure involves the reaction of the tetrabutylammonium
salts of the acids with benzyl bromide in acetone.

require several days of exposure to the inducer, thus making it difﬁcult to identify the early
cellular changes which are fundamental to the differentiation program, and to relate the
induction to phases of the cell cycle. In order to study the kinetics of leukemic cell diﬂ'erentiation
we have developed a system for the induction of rapid monocytic maturation in a subpopulation
of HL 60 cells. The cells are exposed to 10’7 M l,25—dihydroxycholeealciferol for 4 hr in
serum—free medium. Subsequent incubation in a complete medium results in cellular differen-

and are capable of phagocytosis. The proportion of differentiated cells in culture decreases
thereafter. This system has been utilized to study the expression of c-myc oncogene in relation
to the kinetics of maturation, and it was found that the inhibition of the expression of this
gene precedes the onset of phenotypic differentiation by approximately 8 hr, is transient, and
is accompanied by a brief retardation of cell proliferation, which resumes the normal rate
within 24 hr of the exposure to the inducer. © 1985 Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

HL 60 cells, isolated from a patient with
a promyelocytic leukemia (l), have provided
a useful model for maturation of leukemic
cells. In culture, these cells show a low level
tiated forms can be induced by a variety of
chemical compounds. For instance, dimethyl
sulfoxide (2) and retinoic acid (3) produce
conversion in 6—10 days to predominantly
granulocytic cellular forms, while phorbol
esters (4), lymphocyte-conditioned medium
(5), and vitamin D derivatives (6—9) induce
the monocytic/macrophage pathway of dif-
ferentiation after 3—7 days in culture.

The long periods of time required for the
phenotypic manifestations of the inducer ac-
tion suggest that a complex series of steps is
necessary for the expression of the dilferen-
tiation program, and indicate to some that
the process is stochastic in nature (10, 11).
However, a relationship to a speciﬁc cell

duction greater than 24 hr, since this repre-

situation cells are successively recruited into

inducer, making it impossible to relate
changes in cell cycle-linked events to the
maturation process.

OSHA claimes that “A correlation between nicotine absorption and exposure to tobacco smoke
has been demonstrated, thus making nicotine an appropriate marker for tobacco smoke in
pharmacokinetic studies" [59FR, 15974, April 5, 1994] and “It appears that the most effective

\ Nicotine as a speciﬁc marker of ETS exposure:

However, as stated by S.L. Schwartz et al. [S.L. Schwartz et al., 1993] “Nicotine or cotinine
biomonitoring can provide, at best, only semiquantitative information about exposure, and has
only limited ability to estimate dose, duration and time since termination of exposure”. Balter et
al. go even further [Balter et al., 1988], “The predominance of nicotine in the ETS gas phase

be that in real life situations nicotine is present and can be detected with sufﬁcient proportionality
Analytical measurements, however, under deﬁned and reproducible conditions suggest “that
some components of environmental tobacco smoke are dominated by contributions from other
sources in indoor environments (e.g., CO, and to a lesser extent NOX and particles). On the other
hand nicotine and some other components of environmental tobacco smoke (e.g., myosmine)
are found in indoor environments at concentrations lower than would be expected. This is due to
speciﬁc loss of gas phase material by deposition to the surroundings”. [Balter et al., 1988 and
references cited there]. According to Eatough et al. [Eatough et al., 1990] “Environmental
species” and “These changes may preclude the accurate measurement of human exposure to

speciﬁc compounds without actual measurement of the compounds of interest.”

Given these complications, OSHA has to provide a quantiﬁable relationship between the
measured nicotine (or cotinine) levels and the ETS dose taken up. This relationship must specify
error limits in order to be applicable to safety procedures.

In this article we further our investigation of direct DNA inoculation as a tool for induction of relevant im-
mune responses against HIV -1 in viva. We demonstrate expression of HIV «1 antigens in the muscle of eneti-
cally the animals. Inoculated animals demonstrate signiﬁcant cytotoxic T cell responses against HIV -1 antigen-

 

expressing targets. Furthermore, using a novel challenge system, we demonstrate that the majority of

immunized animals can reject lethal, HIV-1 antigemexpressing cell challenge in an antigen-speciﬁc manner.
This technology has relevance for the development of immunization strategies against HIV because it provides

for speciﬁc antigen production in viva without the use of infectious agents.

Rggglts: The heat loss of Ereely smoldering cigarettes has been measured with
a calorimeter. Additionally, the heat loss of cigarettes smoldering on
fabric/foam substrates has also been measured. Cigarettes smoldering on
substrates lose weight at about 85%t0f their rate during free burn. The
cellulosebased fabric used in these experiments has a heat of smoldering
combustion comparable to the cigarettes themselves. The dimensions of the
cigarette coals were unchanged by placing them on the substrate. contrary to
NIST’s observation. The power output of the freely smoldering cigarettes
appears to be a linear function of the MBR, while the heat ﬂux appears to be
independent of MBR.

Further, experiments show that substrates affect cigarette MBRs at separation
distances of up to 4L5 mm, suggesting that the disruption of the boundary layer

We have also monitored the out ﬂow of gases from cigarettes smoldering in free
ﬂow—-this behavior may be related to temperatures cycling in the cigarettes.

Plans: We plan to measure the heat ﬂux of freely smoldering cigarettes and

cigarettes smoldering on fabric/foam substrates as functions of air ﬂow. This
should allow us to determine heat flux as a function of ﬂow rate in order to

explain the role of ﬂow‘ on fabric ignitions.

Introduction

Diﬂerences in mean blood pressure values between

centered on ascribing the higher blood pressure values in

High blood pressure is recognized as one of the more
potent factors for the development of coronary heart dis-
ease. It is related to and possibly interacts with other risk
factors to accelerate the development of this disease. This
multiple potential for illness. disability. and death makes the
clarification of the etiology of the higher blood pressure in
Blacks of prime importance. particularly in view of the long-
tenn public health goal. the primary prevention of hyper-
tension.

Structure-Function Analysis of the Human Papillomavirus
Type 16 E7 Oncoprotein

Division of Virology, Burroughs WeIlL'nme Con, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709,l and
Laboratory of Tumor Virus Biology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 208922

The E7 gene of human papillomavirus type 16 encodes a multifunctional nuclear phosphoprotein that is
functionally and structurally similar to the adenovirus (Ad) ElA proteins and the T antigens of other
papovaviruses. E7 can cooperate with an activated ms oncogene to transform primary rodent cells, trans
activate the Ad E2 promoter, and abrogate transforming growth factor [Eu-mediated repression ofc-myc. Recent
studies suggest that these functions may in part be a consequence of the ability of E7 to associate with the
product ofthe retinohlastoma tumor suppressor gene (pRB). In this study, a series ofsite-speciﬁc mutations of
intracellular protein stability, ms cooperativity, transcriptional tron: activation, pRB association, and
phosphorylation. The results of these studies indicate that the transforming and trans-activating domains
extensively overlap within a region of the protein analogous to conserved region 2 of Ad ElA, suggesting that
pRB binding is necessary for both activities. Deletion of sequences in conserved region 1 abrogates cellular
transformation but has only a marginal died on Iran: activation. These data suggest that E7 trans activation

and cellular transformation are interrelated but separable functions.

 

Both epidemiological and biological data support the divi-
sion of thc mucosa-associated human papillomaviruscs
(HPVS) into two groups: those associated with benign le-
and those represented by HPVlé and HPVIS, which are
considered high risk because of thcir association with intra-
cpirhclial ncoplasia, a precursor to cervical canccr (37), The
E7 proteins of the high«risk HPVs, which are consistently
expressed in HPV-positivc cervical carcinomas and derived
ccll lincs (3, 42, 43), can induce morphological transforma-
tion of established rodcnt cells in culture (7, 22, 37, 49, 50,
52). E7 also can coopcratc with an activated ms or fax
oncogene to transform primary rodcnt cells (37, 48), The
expression ofthc high-risk HPV E6 and E7 proteins together
epithelial cells (19, 20, 29).

The HPV16 E7 protein is an acidic 21-kDa nuclcar phos-
phoprotcin with no known enzymatic activity. The amino
terminus of the HPV E7 protein shares substantial amino
acid sequence similarity with two noncontiguous portions of
the adenovirus (Ad) EIA proteins (37). In addition, E7 is
functionally related to EIA and simian virus 40 (SV-iO] large
T antigen in that it can cooperate with rats, [runs activate the
Ad E2 promoter (37), and abrogatc the transforming growth
factor B-induced transcriptional repression of the c-myc
required for their association with pRB, the product of thc
retinoblastoma tumor susceptibility gene (5, 6, 13, 1-1, 30, 53,
54).

Previous genetic studies indicated that CR1 and CR2 arc
rcquircd for EIA cellular transformation functions, including
stimulation of host DNA synthesis, cooperation with nix,


2413

genes. In contrast, CR3 of EIA, which is prcscnt in the
product of the Ad E1A 13$ RNA but not in thc product of
the 125 RNA, is responsible for thc major ElA-mcdialcd
transcriptional trans-activation function (9. It]. 32). Amino
acid sequences that are similar to that of Ad EIA CR3 are
not prcscnt in SV-li) T antigen or in thc E7 proteins of the
HPVs, suggcsting that this transcriptional regulatory region
is uniquc l0 EiA.

A rcccnt anal sis of HPV16 E7 trans activation indicated
that the binding sitcs for the Cellular transcription factor EZF
arc necessary for activation of thc Ad E2 promoter by both
E7 and EIA. Rcccnt studies have indicated thatthc E21:
transcription factor is a cellular targct for thc pRB protcin (2,
11, 12), The E7 protcin is functionally similar to the 125 ElA
product in that it can perturb the association of EZF with
ccllulur proteins, including cyclin A and pRB (34).

In this study, a series of HPV16 E7 mutants were anzilyzcd
to map the domains involved in the transcriptional trims
activation and cellular transformation functions of the E7
gene product. These data suggest that for IIPV E7, ccllular
transformation and trans activation of the Ad E2 promoter
arc related but separable functions. Cellular transformation
required two scpnratc regions analogous to the Ad EIA CR1
and CR2 domains, and transcriptional mm: activation
mapped to an overlapping region of the CR2 domain.

Possible causes for a decline in the infant mortality rate
during the late 1960s are proposed and examined
statistically.

declined since 1960. From 1980 to 1965 the decline was
negligible and was a cause for alarm. Most of the decline has
Occurred since 1965. During the periodt1965 to 1970 the
rate dropped from about 25 to about 20 deaths per 1,000
live births. Data through 1972 indicate that it is continuing
to fall al the same rate.

One possih'l' explanation for the fall in infant

during the late 19505 The declt 1e in tlhe overall infant

THE K“ CHANNEL OF SARCOPLASMIC RETICULUM

A New Look at Cs+ Block
SAMUEL CUKIERMAN, GARY YELLEN, AND CHRISTOPHER MILLbR
Graduate Department of Biochemistry, Brandeis University, Waitham, Massachusetts

ABSTRACT K*—selective ion channels from mammalian sarcoplnsmic reticulum were inserted into planar phospholipid
bilayers, and single-channel currents measured in solutions containing Cs‘. Current through this channel can be
observed in symmetrical solutions containing only Cs" salts. At zero voltage, the Cs+ conductance is approximately
lS-fold lower than the corresponding K+ conductance. The open channel reetiﬁes strongly in symmetrical Cs* solutions,
and the Cs* currents are independent of Cs* concentration in the range 18~600 mM. Biionic (Cf/K‘) reversal
potentials are only 10 mV, showing that Cs" is nearly as permeant as R ’ , though much less conductive. Addition osz+
to symmetrical K’ solutions reduces current through the channel in L1 voltage—dependent way. The results can be
explained by a free energy proﬁle in which the channel’s selectivity filter acts in two ways: to provide binding sites {or
the conducting ions and to serve as a major rate—determining structure. According to this picture, the main difference


INTRODUCTION

Virtually all K*-selective ion channels interact strongly
with Cs”. Indeed, there is no known case in which 21 KT‘

ivity for K+ over Na *71'5 not profoundly affected by Cs“
K+ current through the open channel, i.e,, it blocks the
channel. The common mechanistic picture of this interac-
tion is analogous to competitive inhibition in enzyme
kinetics: the Cs" ion can enter the normal K” conduction
pathway, but cannot permeate it. Whenever a Csl ion is
thus stuck in the open channel, K+ ions are literally
blocked from permeating. K‘“ ions must wait for the C5*
ion to leave the channel via the same route that it had
entered before they can traverse the pore. Though many
variations in detail have been offered in the literature of

is plausible to propose that simple steric hindrance
accounts for the failure of Cs+ to permeate the selectivity

channel from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), a channel
whose ion conduction properties have been extensively
studied (Coronado and Miller, 1979; Coronado et al.,
1980; Miller et al. 1984). Cs‘ has been shown to reduce
K * currents through this channel in a particularly simple
manner. Cs‘ appears to bind competitively with K“ at a
single site within the channel; the alhnity of Cs+ for this

channel (the .. .‘j side), and since previous studies failed to
detect conduction by Cs‘, we concluded that this blocker
inhibit K‘ conduction (Coronado and Miller, 1979).

The fact that Cs‘ blocks the SR K” channel is surpris-
ing, since it is known (Coronado and Miller, 1982) that
organic cations as large as 0.5 nm in diameter can perme-
ate; the smaller Cs‘ ion, then, cannot be excluded from
permeating for purely stcrie reasons. We now show that
our previous ping—in-the—bottle picture of C5* block is
incorrect, that the Cs” permeability is nearly as high as
that of K'. We also show that a simple picture of Cs+
conduction through the channel can quantitatively explain
all our results on voltage-dependent inhibition of K’
currents by Cs' as well as on open—channel currents under
symmetrical Cs’ and biionic Cs*/K*conditions.

 

MATERIALS AND METHODS

In all experiments here, currents through single channels were recorded

by inserting put SR membrane vesicles into planar lipid bilayers
composed of 907: phosphatidylethanolamine/10% phosphatidylcholine.

This well written proposal from an experienced clinical investigator
proposes to do an exhaustive exploration of the hypothesis that TGF-alpha
produced by NSCLC cells is bound by the EGF-R present in increased
quantity on many such cells to complete an autocrine growth stimulatory
loop.

The methods to be employed are advanced immunological,
cell-biological, and molecular biological methods. The studies employ
cell cultures, nude mouse implantations, molecular genetic techniques and
monoclonal antibody production along with DNA transfections utilizing
sense and antisense sequences.

Ready access to lung cancer operative specimens is available and
specially derived cell-lines and DNA constructs are at hand. Availability
of the mutated K-ras oncogene which exhibits a point mutation in about
half the tested cases of adenocarcinoma of the lung enabled the author and
his associates to clone this K—ras in an antisense orientation in the
APr-l—neo expression vector.

Consequently, it will be possible to determine whether the
presence of an altered K—ras product as well as to determine whether the
TGF-alpha/EGF-R interaction fulfills all the criteria for proving that an
autocrine loop exists in NSCLC.

The author's intellectual and scholarly command of his topic is
manifest in the proposal. His own laboratory background appears to be in
immunology when judged by his listed publications. The only closely
related manuscript is a preprint of which Dr. Roth is the principal
author.

Dr. Fang did his undergraduate work at National Taiwan University in
chemistry and took his master‘s in that field at Carnegie Mellon and a
doctorate in Bio—organic Chemistry at West Virginia. He came to M.D.
Anderson in 1988. His bibliography is very limited.

ABSTRACT Human apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a ligand
for the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and mediates the
cata bolism of several classes oflipoprotcin particles. Binding of
apoE to the LDL receptor requires association of apoE with
lipid in a vesicle or a lipoprotein particle. Because of this
requirement. puriﬁed apoE or apoE derived directly from
bacterial expression system does not bind to the LDL receptor.
To overcome this problem and to facilitate analysis of am!)
structure. recombinant baculoviruses containing the human
apoE cDNA fused to the polyhedrin promoter of Autographa
califarnica nuclear polyhedrosis virus were constructed. The
recombinant viruses were used to infect larvae of the tobacco
hornworm Manduca sum in viva. High levels of lipoprotein
particles containing human apoE were present in the he-
molymph of infected larvae. In contrast to spot?) produced by
recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cells in virro, these
particles were excellent ligands for the LDL receptor.

 

Human apolipoprotein E (apoE) is one of two known ligands
for the low density lipoprotein (LDL)receptor(1). It provides
the speciﬁcity required for the receptor-mediated clearance
of certain classes of lipoproteins. Genetic variation at the
apoE locus that results in defective receptor binding is
associated with hyperlipoproteinemia and accelerated coro
nary heart disease (1).

apoE to its function have relied upon denaturation followed
by in vitro reconstitution of apoE with lipid (3). An alternative
approach to the production ofbiologically active apoE would

possessing a human apoE cDNA in place of the polyhedrin
gene were constructed. After infection of M. sexra larvae.
high concentrations of human apoE were secreted into the
hemolymph in a lipid-associated and biologically active form.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Production of Recombinant Baculoviruses. A 1.2-kilobase-
pair (kbp) EcoRl~Hindlll fragment encoding the apoE-J
cDNA from plasmid pHE53 (11) was tailed with BamHI
linkers (Promega) and cloned into the BamHI site oprcYMl
(12). yielding pAcE3. An Aar lI-Hinl‘l 1.1-kbp fragment
was ligated into the Sma I site of pBluescript M13+ (Strat-
agene). An 8-bp BamHl linker (Promega) was then inserted
at the EcoRV site of this plasmid to produce p52~Bam. The
1.1-kbp BamHl fragfnent from pSZ-Bam was ligated into the
BamHl site of pAcYMl. yielding pAcESV. The resulting
plasmids were cotransfected with the wild-type baculovirus
genome [Autographa califomica nuclear polyhedrosis virus
(AcNPV)] into Spodoptera frugiperda Sf-Zl cells. Recombi-
nant viruses encoding apoE-3 and apoEJV (AcNPV-E3 and
AcNPV-ESV, respectively) were selected. plaque-puriﬁed.
and titered as described (14. 15).

Infection of Cultured Insect Cells and Insect Larvae. Viruses
were used to infect 4 x 10" Sf-21 cells per dish at a multiplicity
of infection of 10. SF-900 (GIBCO) medium (2 ml) was
harvested from infected cells 42 hr after infection. Fourth-
instar larvae [day 2: average mass. 0.5 g; reared as described
(16)] were injected with 1 x 10" plaque-fonning units (pfu) of
recombinant virus and administered a booster with 5 X 10"

1.1 Method

The acute toxicity of MAINSTREAM and SIDESTREAM CONDENSATE col—

lected with an impaction trap (MWSC—I and SWSC—I) of the STANDARD
REFERENCE CIGARETTE 2R1 was determined after a single dermal

application on female ﬁﬂééndce. Signs of intoxication, the dose-
rex response relationship and especially the dose—mortality as well as
mortality time were determined.

Nicotine, water and the pH of the condensate were determined. The

dried condensates were suspended in acetone and the water concen—

tration adjusted to 25 grams/liter. After adjustment of the water

concentration the condensates were stored protected from light at

minus 75 degrees centigrade until 1 day before application and
I thereafter at plus 4 degrees centigrade.

110 female outbred mice, strain CD1, were allocated randomly to 2
equally treated control (10 mice/group), 9 MWSC-I— and 9 SWSC-I—

mice received a single application onto the sheared dorsal skin

316, 464, 681, 1000, 1470 or 2150 mg /kilogram

body weight, calculated on the basis of dry condensate. The con-
 
   
 
 

trol groups received acetone with a water concen ation of 25

 

grams/liter without condensate. The application vo ume was always

I Respiratory Secretions in Pulmonary Carcinoma: Secretory Component of Dnmmoglobuh‘h
A as an Early Marker of Epithelial Dysfunction.

The overall aim of this research project is to find a suitable biochemical
marker(s) , which appropriately reflects the integrity and metabolic function of the
epithelial cell lining layer of the respiratory tract, yet is saxsitive enough to
detect subtle cellular dysfunction before irreversible change or malignant cell
transformation occur. Central to this search is the inhalant injury produced by
cigarette smoke on the airway lining cells. The object is to identify a marker
diseases, or will select the person who is likely to develop a primary lung cancer.
To this end, they have been mien-lining levels of free secretory component (FSC) in

‘ lung secretions. FSC is a unique glycoprotein, synthesized and secreted by the

 

epithelial lining cells of the airways and its production reflects their protein
metabolic capability. Subjects have included young healtly cigarette snokers and

(l) FSC in normal volunteers. Final analyses of FSC and other protein
and cellular components in lung bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) have
' been completed in 56 subjects (32 smokers and 24 nonsmkers) . These
results are in press (American Review of Respiratory Diseases). To
summarize the results, a subset (20%) of young Stoker‘s have very low

. risk for the development of lung disease.

 

(2) FSC in lung cancer patients. To date, 93 patients have been studied
with BAL fluid analysis. FSC values are very low in patients with
squamous cellcarcinana. It appears as if the integrity of secretory
19A is also impaired in the airways of these subjects, possibly
reflecting an inadequate supply of FSC which is essential for coupling
to the dimeric IgA molecule. - .

Expression, Characterization, and Tissue Distribution of a New
Cellular Selenium-dependent Glutathione Peroxidase, GSHPx-GI*

(Received tor publication, March 26, 1992",

Fong-Fong Chut, James H. Doroshow, and R. Steven Eswurthy

Duarte, California 910M]

We have characterized a new selenium-dependent
glutathione peroxidase, GSHPx—GI, by expressing a
GSHPx-GI cDNA isolated from human hepatoma
IIepG2 cells in human mammary carcinoma MCF-7
cells, which have virtually undetectable expression of
either the classical cellular enzyme, GSHPx-l, or
GSHPx-GI at the protein level. One of the G418-re-
sistant clones, neo-Dl, expresses the transfected
GSIlPx-GI cDNA. This is based on 1) the presence of
an additional GSllPx-GI DNA restriction fragment
detected by Southern analysis; 2) the presence of a 1.9-
kilobase (kb) GSHPx-GI mRNA in addition to the 1.0-
kb endogenous mRNA by Northern analysis; and 3) the
appearance of a 22-kDa 75Se-labclcd protein which is
absent in parental MOE-7 cells revealed by SDS—poly-
acrylamide gel electrophoresis.

GSHPx—GI expressed in neo-D] is a tctrameric pro~
react with antisera against human GSHPx-l or human
plasma glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx-P). Similar
GSHPx-GI; they both catalyze the reduction of H202,
tert-butyl hydroperoxide, cumene hydroperoxide, and
linoleic acid hydroperoxide with glutathione, but not
of phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide. GSHPx—GI
and occasionally in human breast samples, but not
other human tissues including kidney, heart, lung, pla-
centa, or uterus. In rodent tissues, GSHPx-GI mRNA
is only detected in the gastrointestinal tract, and not
in other tissues including liver. In fact, GSHl—‘x-GI
appears to be the major glutathione-dependent perox-
idase activity in rodent GI tract. This finding suggests
mammals from the toxicity of ingested lipid hydroper—
oxides.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that GSHPx-
GI is the fourth member in the selenium-dependent
glutathione peroxidase family, in addition to GSHPX-
thione peroxidase (PHGPX).

Selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase activity is due
to the expression of multiple isozymes. Three of the isozymes
have been previously purified and characterized at the protein
level. They are: (a) the classical cellular glutathione peroxi»
dase, GSl-IPx-l‘ (] ). lb) the phospholipid hydroperoxide glu-
tathione peroxidase, l’HGPX [2), and (c) the plasma glutar
thione peroxidase, GSHPx-P (3, 4). Both GSHde and
GSHI’x-P are tetramers and have similar substrate speciﬁci-
ties, They can metabolize H203 and fatty acid hydroperoxides
effectively but metabolize phospholipid hydroperoxide and
cholesterol hydroperoxide poorly [5, 6). On the other hand,
PllG PX is a monomer and has different substrate speciﬁcities
compared to GSHde and GSHPx-P. PHGPX catalyzes the
reduction of phospholipid hydroperoxide, cholesterol hydro»
peroxide, and linoleic acid hydroperoxide much more eft‘ecr
tively than the reduction oil—130.3 and lert-butyl hydroperoxr
ide.

GSHI’Xrl and PllCPX are present in most of the tissues
that have been examined. GSHl’x—l is present abundantly in
erythrocytes, kidney, and liver (7); and I’HGPX is present in
testis at a high level [8). On the other hand, GSHPX’P exhibits
in liver, kidney, heart, lung, placenta, and breast tis 1e:
whereas, in the rodent GSHl’x-P is not expressed in liver.
although rodent kidney has a higher level of expression which
may compensate for no GSHPxP expression in liver (11).
The cDNA sequence of these three glutathione peroxidase
UGA codon coding for selenocysteine (l2—15l,

in addition to these three isczymes, a 24rkl)a epididymal
secretory protein homologous to glutathione peroxidase has
been reported in mouse. This 24rkDa protein is inducible by
testosterone. and it is only expressed in epididymis (16, 17].
Since the published nucleic acid sequence of the 24kDa
included as an isozyme ot‘ the selenium-dependent glutathione
peroxidases is debatable.

We isolated a GSHPXGI clone from human liver and
human hepatoma HepG2 CDNA libraries in Aglll; this (‘DNA
shares sequence homology with (‘xSl-lPx-J. [18]. The CDNA
clone, GSHl‘x»Gl, was subsequently reported by Akasaka cf
(11. (19], who also isolated it from a human liver library.
GSHerGl CDNA contains a UGA codon; this suggests that
isozyme. Because the protein product of GSl—lPx-Gl had not
been identiﬁed, it was possible that GSllerGI was a psetlr
dogene. In this report, we present data on the analysis of

TITLE: Identification And Characterization of Genes that Differentially Regulate
Proliferation in Response to Estrogen Agonists and Antagonists

Abstract:

The overall goal of this investigation is to elucidate the molecular mechamisms by which estrogens
and estrogen antagonists differentially regulate gene expression and proliferation in hormone
dependent tissues and cancers. To address this problem, the hormone responsive MCF—7 human
breast cancer cell line will be used to identify differential changes in gene expression that occur in
response to acute treatment with estrogens and estrogen antagonists. Identified genes will be
sequenced and characterized in estrogen—sensitive and insensitive breast cancer cell lines and in two

Specific Aims

1. To identify specific mRNA species from MCF-7K1 breast cancer cells whose expression is
differentially modulated by estradiol (E2), 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OH-T. a partial hormone
antagonist), or ICI 182,780 (ICI, a complete hormone antagonist). Total cellular RNA will be
obtained from MCF-7Kl cells cultured in the presence or absence of these ligands and analyzed by
the technique of differential RNA display. This technique permits rapid visualization and comparison
of gene expression in target cells following acute treatment with estrogen agonists and antagonists.

2. To clone, identify, and characterize target genes visualized by the differential display technique.
An MCF—7K1 cDNA library will be generated and used to isolate CDNA clones of the differentially
regulated genes. Individual clones will be chosen for further study. if novel genes are identified, the
DNA sequence and temporal expression of selected candidates in response to agonist vs. antagonists
will be determined. If known genes are identiﬁed, the mechanism of regulation by estrogen receptor
and hormone agonist and antagonists will be addressed in several breast cancer cells, vascular
smooth muscle cells, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells of variable sensitivity to estrogens.

Preliminary Studies and Results

RNA differential display was performed according to the method of Liang and Pardee (1, 2).
Brieﬂy, total cellular RNA was isolated from MCF-7 cells cultured in the presence of 50 ug/ml
cycloheximide (CHX) or 50 ng/ml TNF-ot +/— 10 nM E2, 100 nM OH—T, or 100 nM ICI. RNA
differential display identified six putative target genes and two of these were chosen for further
characterization. The ﬁrst gene was identified as monocyte chemoattractant protein—1 (MCP—l).

Expression of M CP—I mRNA by MCF—7 Cells

Unstimulated MCF-7 human breast cancer cells do not express detectable levels of MCP-l mRNA
when measured by Northern blot or ribonuclease protection assay. Treatment with either CHX or
steady state levels of MCP-l mRNA. Co-stimulation of cells with CHX or TNF—ot and 10 nM E2
suppressed steady state levels of MCP-l mRNA. Under these conditions, E2—mediated suppression
of MCP-l mRNA was maximal by 1—4 hours (70% suppression). Two additional estrogens, estriol
and DES, also mediated suppression of MCP—l mRNA levels whereas the synthetic progesterone
receptor agonist, ORG 2058, had no effect. Incubation of the cells with OH—T did not suppress
MCP—l mRNA accumulation and co-administration of 10 nM E2 and 2 uM OH—T or [Cl abrogated
the suppressive E2 effect. OH—T and ICI function as antagonists of E2 action in the breast.
Treatment of cells with actinomycin D did not alter the mRNA stability proﬁle, which suggests that
ER modulates MCP—l mRNA expression at the transcriptional level. A synergistic down regulation

Kinetics of Transfer of Pyrene and



Steven C. Charltont and Louis C. Smith*

ABSTRACT: Control of lipid transfer between plasma lipo-
proteins has been studied with pyrene and a pyrcne-containing
diglyceride analogue, rac-1-oleyl-2-[4-(3-pyrenyl)butanoyl]-
glycerol. The rate constants for transfer of the ﬂuorescent
containing ions of the Hofmeister series are correlated with
the molal surface tension increments produced by this lyotropic
series. Moreover, the rates of transfer correlate well with the
aqueous solubilities of the hydrophobic compounds, which were
increased in dilute solutions containing organic solvents. The
rates of transfer are faster with an increase in the distribution
coefﬁcients of the probes between the lipoprotein donor and
the aqueous phase, suggesting that the ratedetermining process
can be considered simply as a partitioning between two im—
miscible solvents. Rate constants for transfer of pyrene be-
tween high~deusity, low-density, and very low density lipo-
proteins depend on the ratio of the donor/ acceptor lipoprotein

Bast-ha lipoproteins function as circulating reservoirs for a

wide variety of hydrophobic substances that have extremely
low solubility in aqueous solutions (Smith et al., 1978; Scanu
sterol, cholesteryl ester, and phosphatidylcholine as major
components and minor amounts of lipid-soluble vitamins and

. environmentally derived contaminants.

The relatively constant compositions of the circulating li-
poproteins result from ﬁve simultaneous processes: (I) syn-
thesis and secretion, (2) passive transfer and exchange of lipid

concentrations and agree with those predicted from the dis-
tribution coefﬁcients. In addition, the rate of transfer is in-
versely related to the lipoprotein radius, with a linear corre-
lation observed between the log of the rate constant and l /
radius. By analogy with the evaporation of liquid droplets
described by Kelvin’s law, the transfer of a lipid from a li—
poprotein or a membrane surface can be described as kdote'W’
where K is a constant, 1r is the interfacial surface pressure of
a curved surface of a radius r, and k, is the dissociation
constant. These results show that the rate of transfer of lipids
can be modiﬁed by changes in the solubility of the transferring
as solubility of the transferring species in the membrane and
the properties of the lipid—protein surface, may have important
roles in regulating the kinetics of lipid transfer in biological
systems.

and apoprotein components, (3) active transfer involving
speciﬁc plasma exchange proteins, (4) enzymatic changes in
composition involving lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase and
lipoprotein lipase, and (5) removal from circulation by cellular
uptake of lipid and apoprotein components. The dynamics and
the contribution of each process to overall lipoprotein me-
tabolism are poorly defined.

All lipoproteins contain proteins, cholesterol, and phos-
pholipids in a surface ﬁlm that surrounds a neutral lipid core
of choiesteryl ester and triglyceride (Shen et a1., 1977). Li-
poprotein surfaces have the dynamic properties of a two-di-
mensional fluid, in which there are rapid nonoovalent inter—
actions between individual lipid and protein components, in-
volving both rotational motion and translational diffusion in
the surface (Lee, I975; Thompson & Huang, 1978). Because
the lipid components of lipoproteins are soluble in the aqueous
solution to some extent, they also partition between the lipo-
protein surface and the aqueous solution (Charlton et al., 1976,
1978a). Since some lipoprotein components transfer on time
scales (milliseconds to hours) that are much shorter than the

MOLECULAR MIMICRY BETHEEN Fc GAMMA RECEPTOR AND MOUSE HEPATITIS VIRUS PEPLDMER PROTEIN

background. Molecular mimicry is defined as the presence of epitopes, either linear
or conformational, shared between viral and host antigens (1) and may play a role in the
pathogenesis of viral infections and the induction of autoimmune diseases. Several homolo—
gous peptides between human myelin basic protein (MBP) and viral proteins have been identi—
fied including adenovirus, influenza, measles, canine distemper and Epstein-Barr viruses(2).
Molecular mimicry of a peptide comprised of 8 amino acids of MBP by Hepatitis B polymerase
experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE)(3). We have demonstrated (4,5) molecular
mimicry between Fc gamma receptor (chR) and the peplomer protein S (formerly E2) of the
Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV).

MHV strain JHM (MHV-JHM), a member of the Coronavirus family, experimentally produces
several diseases in mice and rats, depending on the dose and route of inoculation and the
age and strain of the infected animals (7-10), MHV-JHM is highly neurotropic (6).Infection
neurons with prominent demyelination. Mice surviving encephalitis (5-10% of those infected)
subsequently develop a persistent, demyelinating disease. The virus was found to persist
of oligodendrocytes (7). However, a relapsing—remitting demyelinating disease, reminiscent
MHV-JHM results in lymphocyte sensitization against MBP (9). Adoptive transfer of these
lymphocytes after in vitro restimulation with MBP results in EAE. These results suggest
that during MHV infection primary demyelination occurs by direct lysis of oligodendrocytes
for the study of the molecular basis of virus-induced demyelinating disease.

Both humoral and cellular immune responses have been implicated in protection from MHV
infection. Anti-MHV-JHM antibodies prevent death from MHV-JHM infection, but they do not
suppress viral replication in CNS (10,11). Furthermore, in the presence of antibodies MHV—
JHM replicates mainly in oligodendrocytes but not in neurons (10). Delayed—type hypersensi—
agreement with the findings with antibodies, they do not inhibit virus replication in CNS
(12). Additionally, cytotoxic T cells (13), cytolytic B cells (14,15) and NK cells (16)
exhibit cytotoxic activity against MHV-JHM-infected cells. Recently, it has been reported
that clearance of MHV-JHM from CNS requires both CD4’ and CDS+ cells (17).
as an 120 kD polypeptide.1t is cotranslationally glycosylated to a 150 kD S precursor which
is subsequently further glycosylated to the 180 kD species. Two forms of the 5 protein are
present on the surface of the virion, the 180 kD and its two non-identical cleaved products
90A kD and 908 kD. S is responsible for attachment of the virus to the host cell, MHV-
induced cell fusion, and for eliciting neutralizing antibodies (20,21).Therefore, the
peplomei‘ S protein plays a central role in the (outcome of MHV infections. We have
demonstrated molecular mimicry between Fc1R and the peplomer protein S of NHV (4,5).

Infection with herpes virus (HSV-l) resulted in the expression on the cell surface of

reported (24) that HSV-l FcR has a novel function: it participates in antibody bipolar
bridging. This has been described as the binding of a single anti—viral IgG molecule by its
Fab end to a viral epitope and by its Fc end to an Fc receptor. [t was demonstrated (24)
that bipolar bridging of immune lgG protects the virus from antibody and complement-
dependent neutralization and, therefore, offers a survival advantage to the virus.

Cytokine Expression in the CNS: Correlation with the Expression of Neuronal Nicotinic
Acetylcholine Receptors

Introduction

Senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type (Alzheimer’s disease, AD) is characterized by
gliosis and deposits of Eli—amyloid protein in various regions of the cerebral cortex and
hippocampus. Changes in the expression of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) have
been observed in the early stages of AD and smoking can delay the onset of this disease
suggesting that smoking may alter the expression of nAChR. Are there other factors that may
contribute to the observed changes in nAChR expression associated with AD? One molecule
that may play a regulatory role in the CNS is lL-i . The cytokine lL-1 induces inflammation and
immunity in the peripheral immune system, but in the CNS lL-1 induces astrogliosis,
cholinergic neuron sprouting, and the production of amyloid proteins. Further, brain lL-1 is
elevated in AD. The purpose of this application is to determine whether changes in cytokine

expression occur in conjunction with and perhaps resulting from, changes in nAChR
expression.

Ongoing studies in my laboratory suggest an overlap in the expression of members of the IL-1
family (lL-ia, lL-1l5, and lL-1ra) and members of the nAChr family in the CNS as measured by
in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. I have also observed that the expression of
some members of each family are co-regulated in PC12 cells subsequent to differentiation into
neuronal-like cells by nerve growth factor (NGF) or into chromaffin-like cells by
dexamethasone. These findings are consistent with the notion that there exists a regulatory
interplay between iL-i, NGF, and nAChRs in the CNS.

The experiments to be proposed will investigate the possibility that the expression of a
cytokine in the CNS both enhances the action of trophic factors that alter the expression of
nAChRs and whose expression in turn is modiﬁed by the production of nAChRs.

An extended family of related cDNAs that encode functional neuronal nAChRs has been
identified. The mammalian neuronal nAChR family consists of at least six a—like subunits
(designated (12. 03, a4, 05, a6, and a7) and three B—like subunits (designated [32, [53, and [34).
In situ hybridization has demonstrated that RNA for each of these subunits is expressed in
unique, but overlapping, regions of the rat brain. The significance of this result is further
supported by studies where the pair—wise injection of in vitro synthesized RNA encoding an
channel properties of the resulting receptors varies with changes in subunit composition.
Although the subunit composition of a native mammalian nAChR remains to be determined,
the high affinity 3H-nicotine binding sites have been shown to be composed predominantly of
a4+f52 subunits and the 1zsl-a-bungarotoxin site corresponds with the expression of the 0']
subunit. As will be detailed below, I propose to combine the use of in situ hybridization and

immunohistochemistry to address the question of co-expression and regulation of nAChRs and
IL-1 .

Similar to the nAChRs, the lL-1 family consists of distinct molecules that are related by
to the lL—1 receptor (IL-1 R) to induce a pro-inflammatory response. The third member of this
family, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-ire) competes with IL-10 and lL-1B for binding of the
receptor but fails to activate the receptor signalling pathway upon binding. Hence lL—1ra is

Summary

A system is described that allows use of recombinant
DNA technology to modify the genome of Influenza vi-
rus, a negative-strand RNA virus, and to engineer vec-
tors for the expression of foreign genes. Recombinant
RNA is expressed from plasmid DNA In which the cod-
ing sequence of the influenza A virus Ns gene is
replaced with that of the chloramphenicol acetyltrans-
ferase gene. When transfected with purified influenza
A virus polymerase proteins—In the presence of helper
virus—the recombinant RNA is amplified, expressed,
and packaged Into virus particles, which can be pas-
saged several times. The data indicate that the 22
5’terminal and the 26 3'terminal bases of the influenza
A virus RNA are sufficient to provide the signals for
RNA into influenza virus particles.
Introduction

Influenza A virus is a negative-strand RNA virus that con-
tains eight different genome segments (Palese, 1977).
These RNAs, together with the P31, P82, PA, and NP pro-
teins of the virus, make up the ribonucleoprotein (RNP)
core, which exhibits the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
activity of the virus (Krug, 1983). Because earlier attempts
to solubilize the polymerase were unsuccessful, it has
only recently become possible to study the sequence re-
quirements for the influenza virus polymerase. Szewczyk
et al. (1988) were able to purify the three P proteins and
the NP protein from acrylamide gels and renature the
complex along with naked RNA using thioredoxin. In addi-
tion, Honda of al. (1988) and Parvin et al. (1989) suc-
ceeded in isolating active polymerase complexes from ri-
bonucleoprotein cores using CsCl-glycerol gradient
centrifugation. In the latter study, the purified P31, P32.
PA, and NP protein complex (depleted of viral RNA) was
then used to study the promoter signals for the polymer-
ase activity (Parvin et al., 1989). Short synthetic RNA mol-
ecules 30—53 nucleotides (nt) in length were transcribed
from appropriate plasmid constructs by T7 RNA polymer-
ase. The resulting RNAs contained, at their ends, se<

quences corresponding to the 5’ and 3' terminal nucleo-
tides of influenza virus RNAs. These RNAs were able to
merase complex.

This ability to reconstitute RNPs in vitro allowed us to
establish that the 3’ terminal nucleotides of an influenza
virus RNA contain the polymerase recognition and pro-
moter sites for transcription. However. the polymerase. pu-
rified from whole virus, was not able to efficiently copy
positive-sense template (Parvin et al., 1989). In addition,
it had previously been demonstrated that the genomic
RNAs in purified influenza virus and in infected cells
formed circles via panhandle structures involving the 3’
and 5’terminal nucleotides (Hsu et al., 1987; Honda et al..
1983). We thus speculated that the untranslated regions
of an influenza virus RNA might be required to obtain effi-
cient replication in vivo and possibly allow for the packag-
ing of the FINAs into virus particles.

In this paper we discuss in vivo experiments using a
recombinant RNA molecule containing sequences corre
sponding to the untranslated 3' and 5'terminal sequences
of the NS RNA of influenza virus A/PRlB/34 flanking the
phenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. This RNA was
mixed with purified influenza virus polymerase complex
and transfected into Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK),
293, or MadinADarby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells. Follow-
ing infection with influenza AIWSNISS virus, CAT activity
was detected in the RNP—transfected cells, indicating am-
recombinant influenza virus gene was packaged into virus
particles, since CAT activity was demonstrated in cells fol-
lowing infection with the recombinant virus preparation.
Virus containing the recombinant gene could be pas-
sagcd several times in cells.

Synthesis of IVACAT1 Template RNA

To study the transcription and replication signals of in-
fluenza A virus RNAs in vivo, we constructed plasmid
pIVACATi (Figure 1), which directs the synthesis of an NS
RNA—like transcript. This RNA shares the 22 5’ terminal
and the 26 3‘ terminal nucleotides with the NS RNA of in-
fluenza NPR/8134 virus and contains—instead of the cod-
ing sequences for the N31 and N82 proteins—sequences
encoding a full-length CAT protein. For cloning purposes
it also contains an additional 8 nt including a Bglll site be-
tween the stop codon of the CAT gene and the stretch of
Us in the 5’ noncoding region. The T7 promoter adjacent
to the 5’ noncoding sequences and the Hgal sits down-
stream of the 3’ and allow for the exact tailoring of the 5’
and 3’ ends. Run-off transcription using 17 polymerase
generates a 716 nt long RNA: lanes 2—4 in Figure 2 show
that the IVACATi RNA is of discrete length and shorter
than the 390 nt long marker NS RNA synthesized by T7
polymerase transcription of pHgaNS (lane 1).

Grant Application No. 1630; Henry Sershen, New York.

Dr. Sershen is a relatively young investigator who did most of his training

and work at New York University.

This is an application similar to the one we had already in the same book which
deals with the mechanism of Parkinson's disease. The previous application
mentioned the fact that smokers seem to have a lesser incidence of Parkinson‘s
introduces a new approach, namely that of using a new compound which can give
quite effective in this respect and is useful in producing a model in rodents.

His approach is both by chemical and electron microscopy. He is also
interested in determining catecholamine levels in brain tissue, GABA levels
and more interesting, receptor binding properties. So far his results have
not turned up anything, but the potential certainly is there.
The application is a little on the thin side, but in some ways it is refreshing.
I get the impression that this man is young and relatively untried, having
worked primarily with his sponsors at New York University. I would like to

know more about the institute where he is working. ‘
. In any case despite its thinness, I think it would

be an interesting application. It is relatively inexpensive and there are
no other funds available. I would take a flyer,

For the diagnosis of cystic librosis, we use the “Macroduct
Sweat Collection System" (Wescor) to sample sweat, and
anion-exchange chromatography to determine its chloride
content. The chromatographic system consists of a What-

buflered mobile phase, and ultraviolet detection at 200 nm,
The sweet chloride concentrations of 10 individuals with
cystic fibrosis ranged from 101 to 131 mmol/L (mean111. SD
9 mmol/L), For 11 controls the values ranged from 13 to 54

injected 5 uL of sweat for each sample. The concentration of
chloride in sweat was determined by the area under the
standards, for which absorbence at 200 nm was linearly
related to physiological concentrations of chloride in sweat
(0—150 mmol/L).

For comparison, we determined sweat osmolality with a
vapor pressure osmometer (Wescor, Logan, UT 84321), a
method shown to be reliable in the diagnosis of CF (4, 5 ).

Reagents. We used reagent-grade monobasic potassium
phosphate and doubly distilled de-ionized water to prepare
the mobile phase, which was then ﬁltered and de-gassed.
Standard chloride solutions were prepared with doubly
distilled de-ionized water and reagent-grade sodium chlo-
ride,
Procedures. We sampled sweat from 10 individuals with
CF and from 11 normal controls, using the “Macroduct
Sweat Collection System" (Wescor‘) (4). This system uses
pilocarpine iontophoresis followed by sweat collection in a
that ﬁts snugly over the iontophoresed skin and is secured
by Velcro straps. The sweat ﬂows into a small hole at the
center of the “Macroduct” and into a microbore spiral plastic
tube. The intact sweat is then directly injected into the
chromatographic system.

Results and Discussion

The sweat chloride concentrations and sweat osmolalities
of the CF individuals and controls are shown in Table 1. In
patients with CF the concentrations of chloride in sweat
were 101 mmol/L or more, whereas controls had values 54
mmol/L or less These results were consistent with the
known phenotypes of the controls and the CF patients. in
addition, there was complete agreement of the sweat chlo-
ride concentrations with the sweat osmolality determina-
tions.

This anion—exchange chromatographic method for diagno-
made possible by the ease and reliable procurement of sweat
with the Macroduct Sweat Collection System, a system that
potentially can be used in connection with a variety of
analytical techniques.

This sweat collection system overcomes many of the
problems of previous approaches (6). Its advantages include:
no condensate error, an easily visible sample, complete
recovery of sweat (i.e., there is almost no dead space),

Abstract

Activating the protein-tyrosine kinase activity of v-Fps
leads to the rapid transcriptional activation of the Egr-t
gene, which encodes a mitogen-responsive
transcription factor. Activation of [gut by v-Fps was
insensitive to protein kinase C depletion, suggesting
that a protein Irinase C-independent signal activated by
Fps in transient expression assays induced Egr-t
promoter activation. v-HaRas and v-Rai also aciivated
the {gr—l promoter). To characterize HaRas and Rat-t
involvement in v-Fps-induced [gr-1 expression, we
used recently characterized dominant negative mutants
of HaRas and Rat-1. v-Fps-induced Egr-t promoter
activation was inhibited by the dominant negative
mutants of both Haltas and Rat-1. v-HaRas-induced
Raf-t mutant; however, v-Rai-I-induced Egr-t
promoter activation was unaffected by the inhibitory
Hallas mutant. these data suggest that v-l-‘ps activates a
protein kinase C ~independent intracellular signaling
pathway that is dependent on both HaRas and Rai- 1,
where Ral~t iunctions downstream of HaRas.

COMPOSITION AND PROCESS FOR ~~é '9 ' In “ ';- «. ',
ABSORPTION OF HCN; PM #576 wry. 8:11:

Drs. Norman B. Rainer and Charles B.rﬁoelzel of the
Research and Development Department of Philip“Morrfs:-incr:--

proved absorbents for hydrogen cyanide.

The invention is a class of absorbents for HCN for
use in cigaret filters and other applications where selec-
tivity is desired, comprising amine complexes of certain
heavy metal salts, particularly the complexes of cuprous
salts, carried on solid substrates.

For selective removal of HCN from cigaret smoke various
filter compositions have been proposed. Alkaline additives
such as alkali metal carbonates and the like have been ap-
plied to conventional filter materials. Activated carbon or
charcoal with a surface treatment of copper salt converted
by heat to the oxide have been tried. Keith et al, U. S.
#3,251,365 discloses iron and zinc oxides on high—area car-
acetate as absorbent,made alkaline with certain bases such as
polyethylenimine, triethanolamine, sodium acetate, or borax.
These compositions have some effectiveness in removing HCN
preferentially. The best results reported Show 50 to 85%

removal of HCN. Moreover, the activated carbon types remove

so that there is an effect on flavor of the smoke stream.

The present inventors have discovered that it is
possible to remove 90% to 100% of the HCN from smoke, by the
proper choice of absorbent quantity, substrate, and condi-
tions as will be described in detail below. At least certain
of these absorbents have been shown to be relatively harmless
and non—toxic. They are easily prepared and quite inexpensive.

The substrate for the complex should be a solid having
a surface area of at least one square meter per gram and
preferably much larger. A particularly effective support will
be discussed below. The complex compound may be applied to
this from solution (perhaps 0.2% to 5% concentration) in a
volatile solvent, such as alcohol, and the solvent evaporated.
bent may be used. The absorbent/support is then made a part
of the cigaret filter so that the smoke will have intimate
contact with it. If the support is granular, this may be done
by filling a space in a filter plug with the material so as to

metastases

Project Description

We propose to study the regulatory role of TNF and its two receptors, TNFR—l and TNFR-Z, and the
mechanism of the involvement of this cytokine in the pathogenesis and genetic predisposition to
autoimmune disease.

Systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE), a prototypical human autoimmune disease, is a disorder of
generalized autoimmunity characterized by multi-system organ involvement and autoantibodies against
nuclear, cytoplasmic and cell surface antigens. The mechanism(s) responsible for the breakdown of
tolerance for these self antigens are unknown. In search for mechanisms responsible [or immune
important protective role under the appropriate conditions in a mouse model of SLE, the (NZBxNZW)Fl
111106.

The TNF genes, which include the TNFa, LTa, and the recently cloned LTB genes, are unique among
all known cytokines and growth factors in that they are the only cytokine genes located within the central
portion of the Major Histocompatability Complex (MHC). Because of TNF‘s location, and because many
of its potential biological activities are related to immunoregulation and inﬂammation, the possibility that an
"abnormal" TNF gene could be involved in autoimmune diseases was tested experimentally. I have shown
that activated peritoneal macrophages from NZW mice produce 5- to 10-fold lower levels of TNFa than
non-autoimmune strains. Furthermore, this low TNF production was associated with a unique
polymorphism in a simple tandem repeat sequence identiﬁed within the promoter region of TNth. Most
importantly, treatment of NZBxNZW mice with recombinant TNFoc caused a very signiﬁcant reduction in
the incidence of nephritis and other autoimmune disease parameters in the treated mice.

Further studies have revealed that: (l) TNF production is reduced also in a subset of patients with
lupus, similarly to the (NZBXNZW)F1 mice that have an inherited lupus—like autoimmune disease. (2)
Lupus patients with low TNF inducibility have a 3—5 fold increase in nephritis incidence; (3) In classical
backcross experiments we showed that low TNF production in the NZW mouse is linked to the MHC;

In search of the mechanism of low TNF production in the lupus mouse, we have cloned and
sequenced the 5' regulatory regions from a total of 12 high- and low-TNF producer autoimmune and
normal mouse strains as well as the 3'UTR of the TNF gene, from the stop codon at position 6215-6217
downstream (approximately 1.0 kb), in several strains. Several single bp mutations in the S’region and
nine sites were found to be associated with mutational events in the 3’UTR. The most interesting
mutations were in the 3’UTR: a 5 base GACAC insertion at position 6381 and a 3 bp insertion of CAT,
which disrupts the first AU-motif of TNFoc in the NZW mouse. To probe the functional relevance of the
5' regulatory regions and the 3‘UTR mutations in the TNF gene, we have made constructs in which 5'
TNF promoter fragments from the low—TNF producer NZW mouse or from the high—TNF producer SWR
mouse were linked to the luciferasc reporter gene followed by 3'UTR sequences from the NZW mouse,
or 3‘UTR sequences from the non mutated SWR strain. The different constructs were transiently
expressed in the RAW 264 cell line, activated with LPS and IFN'y, and luciferase activity measured.
Results published recently (J. Immunol. article enclosed) suggest that mutations in the 3' untranslated
region of the TNF gene may be primarily responsible for the genetic defect in NZW mice. It is noteworthy
that, while luciferasc activities are signiﬁcantly reduced in the constructs with the 3‘UTR originating from
the NZW mouse, the level of luciferase mRNA is not affected suggesting that this is a post-transcriptional
effect.

As a ﬁrst step in investigating the regulatory mechanisms of TNF and their distinct signal transduction via
each receptor, we considered isolation and characterization of the mouse receptors to be important. The

We also cloned the mouse TNF—R2 and recently completed the sequence of the gene. We are now in a
strong position to be able to directly analyze and fully characterize the promoter of TNFR—Z in comparison
with the promoter of TNFR-l. In parallel with cloning of the promoters of the receptors for regulatory
studies, we have done regulatory experiments comparing the expression of the two TNF receptors using

Lead (Pb++) Promotes Apoptosis in Newborn Rat Cerebellar
Neurons: Pathological Implications

ABSTRACT

Despite mandated reduction In environmental lead (Pb‘T),
with devastating effects on CNS development. To replicate
aspects of this neurotoxicity, we used cultured granule cells
from newborn rat cerebella to study whether apoptotic or ne-
crotic death is the major consequence of exposure to low
: 10 nM), Pb" does not affect glutamate—induced neuronal
necrosis but promotes neuronal apoptosis, as characterized
morphologically by cell shrinkage and chromatin condensation,
biochemically by the typical internucleosomal DNA fragmenta—
tion and functionally by dependence on new synthesis of mac«

\
X

romolecules (cycloheximide and actinomycin D-sensitivelt The
low micromolar doses of Pb+ * that promote apoptosis are well
within the blood level range reported to impair CNS function in
children and to alter synaptogenesis in the neonatal rat brain.
Thus these in-vitro results suggest that the highly neurotoxic
action of Pb ' ’ in the developing CNS of children might depend
on a facilitation of apoptosis. The Pb*+—ellcited potentiation of
neuronal apoptosis is attenuated by treatment with the voltage-
sensitive Ca++ channel agonist Bay K8644, which suggests the
effects of Pbe.

 

Subchronic or chronic exposure to PbH' is highly neuro-
toxic, affecting particularly the developing CNS (Hammond
and Dietrich, 1990). In children, Pb‘ ' blood levels as low as
1.3 to 13 prM, may affect CNS development, leading to mental
retardation, impaired visual motor coordination and permav
nenI: cognitive deﬁcits (Goldstein, 1992). Rodents exposed to
Pb‘ * just before or after birth exhibit abnormal cytoarchi-
tectonic changes in development of the hippocampus and the
cerebral cortex, reduction in the number and diameter of
axons in the optic nerve and demyelinization of peripheral
nerves (Rodier, 1995). Recent data on the interaction of low
doses obe‘” with neonatal brain synaptogenesis have led to
the hypothesis that, this metal may interfere with the process
of synapse trimming by reducing the ratio between active
and inactive synapses (Goldstein, 1990). There appear to be
in vitro counterparts of the in viva neurotoxicity, because
embryonic hippocampal and neonatal rat cerebellar neuronal
cultures exposed to low concentrations of Pb"+ (1-100 all)
fail to differentiate fully or grow (Holtzman et (11., 1987; Kern
et al., 1993).

A number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain
why Pb++ impairs neuronal function, including inhibition of

aerobic energy metabolism (Holtzman et LIL, 1980), substitu-
tion of Pb * ' for CaH (Markovac and Goldstein, 1988), inhi-
bition of Na'lIC—ATPase activity (Chanez et 01., 1988),
blockade of VSCCS (Audesirk G., 1993) and blockade of
NMDAAselective glutamate receptors (Ujihara and Albuquer-
que, 1992). It has also been suggested that the influence of
Pb’ ‘ on neuronal growth, survival and differentiation is
indirectly mediated via a toxic action on glial cells (Tiffani-
Castigliuni ei ul., 1989).
Several lines of evidence support the notion that neuro-
toxic agents may cause neuronal death in the developing
brain by two mechanisms: 1) apoptosis [Martin et ELL, 1988;
Oppenheim, 1991; Martin et al., 1992; Franklin and Johnson,
1992; Raff et al., 1993) or 2) necrosis (Choi, 1988; Manev et
al., 1989, 1990; Koh 95111., 1995). Necrosis is a form of Ca”—
dependent neuronal death that may be prompted by an ex-
cessive and protracted stimulation of speciﬁc glutamate re-
ceptors. Apoptosis, on the other hand, is a form of neuronal
death that occurs during development and can be triggered
DNA laddering and is‘blocked in vitro by a number ofprotein
synthesis inhibitors.

Abstract

A two heating zone pyrolysis system capable ofa heating rate of41) OC/second and a
flow rate of 70 nil/second was coupled to a rapid scanning Fourier transform infrared
spectrometer (FTIR). This fast evolved gas analysis system was applied to the study of the
simultaneous evolution of low molecular weight gas phase products, such as C0, C03, H30,
CH4, C2H4, and CHZO during the pyrolysis of cellulose, Different pyrolytie conditions, including
heating rate, gas ﬂow rate, and residence time, were tested to study their effects on the formation
controlled heating environment and sample temperature measurement. Levoglucosan, a major
products from cellulose and levoglueosan showed great similarities and provided insights into the
precursors and formation mechanisms of gas phase products, This experimental method
provides not only a technique to analyze evolved gases in real time, but information on reaction
mechanisms as well as a way to distinguish and control primary and secondary reactions.

COMMENTS ON CANCER INCIDENCE

 

Epidemiological studies of death rates have claimed that a strong

If one is interested in analyzing the factors that may be involved
more pertinent to analysis than are death rates.

No attempt to cover all epidemiological data on cancer morbidity
has been made but the data from reports by two State Departments of Health(l’2)
are sufficiently challenging to justify their presentation and to urge further
collection, study and analysis of similar data from other sources.

As examples of the claimed increased risk of cigarette smokers

(3)

over non-smokers, Hammond and Horn 1958 give the figures of 31 times for lung
cancer, 7 times for buccal cavity_cancer, and 1.90 for genito.urinary cancer in"
however, a "catchall" classification of cancer of "other specific sites," in which
cigarette smokers is recorded as being only 0.89 that of non-smokers.

It is fair to state, therefore, that there is no epidemiological
evidence of association of cigarette smoking with death from skin cancer.
It has repeatedly been claimed that the generally-admitted increase
in cigarette smoking during the past several decades is a significant, if not the
main, causative factor in the increased death rate from lung, buccal cavity and

prostatic cancer.

Let us see whether incidence rates of these diseases bear out this

sweeping and basic hypothesis. Data are given in Table l.

Heredity, Personality Traits. Product Attitude, and
Product Consumption—An Exploratory Study

' INTRODUCTION

This article focuses on the relationships bctw een per-
sonality traits. product attitude. and product consump-
tion. It has been assumed in most previous studies in
this area [1. 2. 6. 7. l6. l7. l9. 25. 26. 27. 29] that
some forrn' of reciprocal relationship exists between
product attitude or consumption and speciﬁc personality
traits. There is evidence [4. 8. ll. l2. l4] which suggests
that personality in itself—is affected by heredity. in this
article we shall examine the extent to which heredity can
explain the variance in speciﬁc personality traits, prod-
uct attitude. and product consumption, individually as
well as their interrelationships”

The selection of products and personality traits for
this study was based on results front previous studies.
For personality traits. extraversion-introvcrsion (El) and
anxiety (A) were selected using scales devised by; Es;
scnck [101 and Bendigjgl respectively. Eysenclr and
Prcll {l3}. Eyscnclt—TW. and Shields [20] found these
traits to have a signiﬁcant genetic component. For prod-
uct attitude and consumption. cigarettes. coffee. and al~
cohol were selected for two reasons. First. consumers of
sumption. making it diflicull for them to stop. Second.

showed a signiﬁcant heritability on the amount con-
sumed. Although the relationship. if any. between ha-

bitual consumption and heredity has not been estab-.
lisbcd. it is notunreasonablc to hypothesize a relationship
betw een the two. . .
Some evidence was introduced by Smart [2|]. who
found a curvilinear relationship between anxiety and the
frequency of drinking among college students, using
Taylor's Manifest Anxiety Scale. Eyscnck [l2]‘found
'estraversion to be related to cigarette smoking. and
Smith [22. 23]. in two separate studies using college stu-
dents and preadult subjects and a diﬂcrent scale from
the one developed by Eyscnclt. has found that smokers
scored signiﬁcantly higher on measures of extrav‘crsion.

Introduction

The genetic damage caused by both ionizing and non-
ionizing radiation plays an important role in neoplastic
development. The eukaryotic cellular response to radiation
is mold—faceted and involves, in part, a cell cycle arrest at
the GlJS or GZI‘M boundary (Kucrbitx er al, 1993} and an
apoptotic pathway of programmed cell death (Cohen e! (22.,
allows time for the repair of damaged DNA prior to
replication or division,'while apoptosis may be a
mechanism to eliminate genetically damaged cells. Recent
evidence has suggested that p53 , which plays an important
tissues {Levine et al., 1991; Lane & Benchimol, l990), is
additionally centrally involved in of the cellular response to
radiation (Lee et (11., 1994), and in controlling the
radiation-induced GUS cell cycle arrest (Koerhitx at of,
1993) and apoptosis (Lowe e: 03., l993; Clarke e: a!.,

. 1993).

Exposure to ionizing (Kastan 2: al., 1991; Lu and Lane,

1993) or non-ionizing {Lu and Lane, l993) radiation .

causes an increase in the intracellular levels of p53, most
protein (Kastan 2: 3L, 1991). The p53protein is a
transcription factor (Fields and long, 1990; Raycroft et (11.,
Ginsberg et al., l991; Farmer er £21., 1992), and the
radiation—induced increase in p53 levels leads to a
transcriptional upregulation of the p.21cm gene (Dulic et
al., l994). lecm was initially identified as a gene
regulated by p53 (El-Deity 21 £11., l993) and as a protein
which interacts with the cyclin dependent kinase (Cdk)
Cdk2 (Harper e: 31., 1993). The cyclical activation and
inactivation of Cdks regulates cell cycle progression
(Chutsubo & Roberts, 1993), and p21cm is a potent
inhibitor of Cdk l, 2 and 4 function (Harper e: (21., 1993).
Cdk 2 becomes activated late in Gi and a complex bitumen
active Cde and cyclin E is required for commiunent into
S phase (Ohtsubo & Roberts, l993). p53 dependent up-
regulation of leC‘PI causes a' direct inhibition of cdk 2
activity, resulting in cell cycle arrest at the GUS border.
Cells which lack p53 function continue cycling through
Gl/S after irradiation and halt cell cycle only at G2I'M,
suggesting that both p53 and 1321““ play necessary roles
in a radiation-induced GUS cell cycle checkpoint

_ (Kuerbitx et aL, 1992).

In addition to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis is a frequent
consequence of the exposure of mammalian cells to 'y-
a variety of diverse cell types, and also plays a necessary
role in a pathway of radiation-induced apoptosis in
£21., 1993). One of the consequences of the losslof this p53
dependent, radiation-induced pathway of apoptosis is that
cells from p53 deficient animals become highly resistant to
the killing effects of y-radiation (Lee and Bernstein, 1993;
Lotem and Sachs, 1993). This radio-resistant phenotype
associated with loss of p53 function may be one
mechanism by which tumours with p53 mutations acquire
resistance to radio-therapy and other chemo-therapeutic
agents (Lowe e: (11., l993b). 7 1

The importance of p53 in both tumour suppression and

., the radiation—response suggests that the two may be

intimately related. The carcinogenic properties of radiation
presumably stem from its ability to cause DNA damage.
Thus, p53 may suppress tumour formation, in part, by
with this idea, cultured fibroblasts lacking p53 have _

elevated levels of polyploidy (Harvey et aI., l993) and
gene amplification in vitro (Livingstone e: 51., l992; Yin

gigggg: Doublewrapped models of 17.0 mm circumference cigarettes
were made with perforated and nonperforated outer wrap to
determine the effect of perforation on analytical and subjective
results and sidestream visibility. Analytically there were no
differences. However, several expert smokers found a difference
in RTD between the samples, and it was felt that the nonperforated
outer wrap resulted in‘RID that is unacceptably high. The
nonperforated outer wrap also resulted in a slightly higher
reduction in sidestream‘visibility.

Samples of Trim V outer and inner liner were submitted for
on the inner liner were consistent with expected values and
represented acceptable variation. Phosphate levels on the outer
found to be lower than levels reported by K—C.

Regular circumference cigarette models containing high and low
levels of MAP were evaluated by the sidestream panel, and the low
level sample was preferred. Several different types of CMC were
also evaluated (NB. CHC, KCMC, CaCMC) and were found to be
subjectively unacceptable.

The low sidestream 2h blend was modified for logistical

configuration using this modified blend and with the existing low
sidestream blend several of these models had charcoal filters at
varying loading levels. The sidestream panel evaluated‘these
cigarettes and felt that a 30 mg charcoal loading resulted in‘a
better smoke with the 2A blend. A charcoal filter does not appear
to offer the same advantage for the modified 2A blend.

The S-port visibility instrument was installed in a lab in the CI
area, and it has been used in trial runs. There is very good
results automatically generated by the PC attached to the 8-port
instrument. Computerization of the single port has shown larger
differences in data, compared to previous light extinction values
from bit pad analysis. Several modifications to the PC collection

Lp(a) competes with plasminogen for binding to cells but it is not
directly with plasrninogen receptors. In the present study, we demon-
strate that Lp(a) can interact directly with plasminogen binding sites on
nionocytoid U937 cells and endothelial cells. The interaction of Lp(a)
dependent and temperature sensitive, characteristics of plasminogen
binding to these sites. The afﬁnity of plasminogcn and Lp(a) for these
sites also was similar (Kd : 1-3 uM), but Lp(a) bound to fewer sites
(~10-fold less). Both gangliosides and cell surface proteins with car-
boxy—terminal lysyi residues, including cnolase, a candidate plzismino-
gen receptor, inhibited Lp(a) binding to U937 cells. Additionally, Lp(a)
interacted with low afﬁnity lipoprotein binding sites on these cells
which also recognized LDL and HDL. The ability of Lp(a) to interact
with sites on cells that recognize plasminogen may contribute to the
pathogenetic consequences of high levels of circulating Lp(a).

Introduction

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a distinct lipopmtein particle, which is as-
sociatcd with the development of premature atherosclerosis and with
disease processes involving thrombosis (1—7]. Lp(a) has a structure si-
milar to low density lipoprotein (LDL) but contains an unique apopro»
tein, apoprotein(a) [apo(a)], which is disulﬁde-linkcd to apoB-lOO.
Apo(a) is highly homologous to plasminogen. The cDNA of the, apo(a)
isoforrn which was sequenced predicted a structure containing 38
kringles, disulﬁde-looped structures of ~80 amino acids; of these, 37
identical to kringle 5 of plasminogen (8) The kringies of plasminogen
possess lysine binding functions and are important in mediating the
interactions of plasminogen with its substrates and inhibitors Lp(a)
particles also may exhibit lysine binding properties and interfere with

functions of plasininogen which depend upon kringle-mediated inter-
actions (945)

Plasminogen interacts with cell surfaces via its kringles (16). The in-
teraction of plasrninogcn with cells has ptoﬁbrinolytic consequences,
and Lp(a) competes for the interaction of plasminogen with cells
(1-7—19). This competition inhibits plasrninogcn activation on cell sur-
atherosclerotic risks associated with high levels of circulating Lpt a).
The interpretation of these experiments has been that Lp(a) binds to
plasminogen receptors. Although apo(a) binds directly to endothelial
cells, it was not shown whether this interaction was inhibited by plas—
minogen (19). Lp(a) binding to human monocyte-derived macrophages
has been demonstrated, but a potential contribution of plasminogen
binding sites was not evaluated in this study (21). Indeed. apota) has
the ability to interact with adherent skin ﬁbroblasts via mechanisms
not shared with plasminogen (22). Moreover. direct interaction of
apo(a) with a mouse macrophage cell line (P388D.I) was inhibited by
acetylated LDL and was totally unaffected by plasminogen (23).

Based upon these inconsistencies, we have sought to test whether the
intact Lp(a) particle can interact directly with plasminogen binding
sites on cells. Complicating such an analysis are the interactions of
Lp(a) with lipoprotein binding sites on cells. Interaction of Lp(a) with
the high afﬁnity apoB/E receptor for LDL has been demonstrated
although Lp(a) appears to have a lower afﬁnity for these sites (24—26).
Interaction of modiﬁed Lp(a) with the scavenger receptor, which also
binds other modiﬁed (acetylated or oxidized) but not native Iipopro-
teins. has been demonstrated (27). Finally, many cells express “non—
selective" lipoprotein binding sites (28 —3 l ). These sites bind both LDL
and HDL. Such interactions are presumably dependent upon the lipid or
action of Lp(a) with plasminogen binding sites, we have selected
interaction with lipoprotein binding sites.

and >0.4%, respectively. Lp(a)-free LDL (21), HDL (34) and acetylated LDL

Viirious pathways have been postuliued for nicotine degrada-
tion involving an initial attack at either the pyridine or the
pyrrolidine rings. The evidence for the suggested pathways has
been provided mainly by the isolation hf a variety of compounds
previously had been fed nicotine (5, 6). Unfortunately, because
of the complexity of thme systems it. is not certain whether the
isolated products are directly or indirectly derived from nicotine,
nor is the sequence of their appearance clearly established. In}
an eﬁort to avoid the diliiculties inherent in the use of complex
systems. studies of nicotine metabolism were attempted at the
enzyme level employing crude and fractionated extracts derived

polarity is that the cell’s plasma membrane is divided
axons and dendrites in neurons, the growing bud and mating
projection in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and lamel—
lipodia in ﬁbroblasts. However, the best—studied type of
polarity is found in epithelia, which is the most common type
of tissue in animals (52, 56). In simple epithelia the cells
form a monolayer where one surface of the cell—the
apical—faces the outside world or a topologically equivalent
space, such as the lumen of the intestines. This is separated
by tight junctions from the basolateral surface, which con-
Apical and basolateral surfaces have very diﬂerent protein
and lipid compositions (4, 10, 57). For example, the
basolateral surface contains receptors for adhering to other
cells and the basement membrane, and for uptake of
nutrients from the circulation. The apical surface contains
transporters for exchanging small molecules with the outside
world. As epithelial cells divide and differentiate they must
send proteins to the correct surface to establish their polarity

As shown in Fig. 1, epithelial cells use two pathways to send
proteins to the correct surface. Newly made proteins can

whereas vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) buds from the
basolateral surface (53). Viral envelope proteins, hemagglu-
tinin (HA) of inﬂuenza and G protein of VSV (VSVG), travel
through the secretory pathway together to the trans-Golgi
network (TGN). Here they are packaged into separate vesi-
cles that carry these proteins to the apical and basolateral
MDCK proteins are also delivered directly from the TGN to
their ﬁnal destination (33). Hepatocytes, in contrast, lack
a pathway from the TGN to the apical (canalicular) surface
and rely entirely on the indirect, transcytotic route (3). The
cntcroeyte—like CaCo-Z cell line uses a mixture of the direct
and transcytotic strategies (32, 42). For several apical pro-
teins a fraction is delivered directly from the TGN to the api-
shOWn for the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR)
transfected into these cells (45), as well as for endogenous
proteins (5).

Both the cell type and the protein inﬂuence the route taken
to the apical surface. For example, dipcptidyl pcptidase IV
(DPP—IV) and aminopeptidasc N (APN) use the transcytotic
route in liver and both routes in CaCoZ cells. When trans-
fected into MDCK cells, they mainly use the direct route
from the TGN to the apical surface (39, 66). However, about
20% of both travel to the MDCK basolateral surface. In the
case of APN, this wasjudged to be a non-transcytosing pool,
although transcytosis was evaluated indirectly (66). If true,
this would imply that in MDCK cells, basolateral APN is un—
able to be transcytoscd and that transcytosis depends on the
cell type. In contrast, we found that the 20% of DPP—IV
reaching the basolateral surface is then transcytosed (11).

An integral membrane protein (LMP2) blocks reactivation of
Epstein—Barr virus from latency following surface

ABSTRACT The role of latent membrane protein 2
(LMP2) in Epstein—Barr virus (EBV) infection was evaluated
by using intently infected primary B lymphocytes that had been
growth transformed by wild-type or speciﬁcally mutated EBV
recombinants. LMP2 null mutant recombinant EBV-infected
cells were similar to normal B lymphocytes in their rapid
globuljn crosslinking. These cells also became more permissive
for lytic EBV replication. In sharp contrast, wild-type control
infected cells had little or no increase in intracellular free
calcium or In permissivity for EBV replication. The block to
surface immunoglobulin crosslinking-induced permissivity in
cells expressing wild-type LMP2 could be bypassed by raising
intracellular free calcium levels with an ionophore and by
activating protein kinase C with phorbol 12-myristate 13-
acetate. LMPZA, not LMPZB, mediates this effect on calcium
mobilization. Genetic and biochemical data are consistent with
these effects being due to the interaction of the LMP2A
N-tenninal cytoplasmic domain with B lymphocyte src family
tyrosine kinases.

 

Epstein—Barr virus (EBV) is a herpes virus that establishes
latency in B lymphocytes during primary infection. Latent
infection of B lymphocytes is likely to be essential for
perpetuation of this virus in human populations, since virus
reactivation from latency is the major reservoir of virus for
infection of susceptible hosts. In latent infection, the virus
can express six nuclear proteins [EBV nuclear antigens
(EBNASH, two integral membrane proteins [latent mem-
brane proteins (LMPs)], and two small RNAs, thereby caus-
ing proliferation of the infected lymphocyte (1—3). Latently
infected lymphocytes can cause a lymphoproliferative dis-
ease in immunodeﬁcient individuals (4—6). The EBNAs and
LMPs are being intensively studied since they are likely to be
involved in the maintenance or regulation of latency or of the
concomitant effects on cell proliferation. This report focuses
expressed in latently infected B lymphocytes (7—9).

Two forms of LMP2 (designated LMPZA and -2B) are
expressed in latently infected B lymphocytes. Both forms are
encoded by highly related mRNAs composed of eight cxons
with a single long open reading frame, differing only in their
first exons (10—12). The ﬁrst exon of LMPZA encodes a
119-amino acid hydrophilic N terminus that is unique to
LMP2A. The promoter for LMPZB is in the ﬁrst LMPZA
intron, and the ﬁrst LMPZB exon is noncoding. The first
codon of the second exon in LMPZA and -ZB is a methionine
codon, at which translation of LMMB initiates, That methi-
onine is followed by 12 predicted hydrophobic transmem-

-2B posttranslationally insert into membranes (12).

Although initial biochemical evidence pointed to an im-
portant role for LMP2 in cell growth transformation, EBV
recombinants with mutations affecting any part of LMP2 are
fully competent for inducing B~lymphocyte transformation
and the transformed cells are indistinguishable from wild type

LMPl is a key effector of EBV-induced cell growth trans-
formation (15—20). Furthermore, LMPZA patches in the
plasma membrane are major sites of tyrosine phosphoryla—
tion, and LMPZA is associated with. and tyrosine phosphor-
The experiments described in this report were designed to
test the hypothesis that a key role of LMP2 in interacting with
src-related tyrosine kinases is to block transmembrane signal
transduction in lurently EBV—infected lymphocytes and
thereby prevent fortuitous activation oflytic infection. Three
previous lines of evidence are consistent with this hypothe-
activate a switch [0 lyric replication in a few latently EBV-
infected cell lines (22. 23). The cell line in which crosslinking

Role of myosin light-chain phosphorylation in endothelial

Shasby, and D. Michael Shasby. Role of myosin light-chain
phosphorylation in endothelial cell retraction. Am. J, Physiol.
265 (Lung Cell Mal. Physiol. 9): L606—L612, 1993.—
Endothelial cells retract centripetally when they are exposed to
histamine and when extracellular calcium is chelated. This cen-
tripetal retraction implies that a centripetal tension must be
expressed in the cells. We asked whether phosphorylation of the
light chain of myosin (MLC) was important for the retraction to
occur, and, by inference, expression of the tension. In human
umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells and in porcine pulmo—
nary rotary endothelial (PPAE) cells tryptic peptide maps in-
kinase (MLCK). Activity of MLCK is inhibited by ML-9, a
kinase inhibitor with relative speciﬁcity for MLCK, and when
MLCK is phosphorylated by the adenosine 3’,5'-cyc1ic mono—
phosphate (CAME-dependent kinsse. Pretreatment of HUVE
cells or PPAE cells with ML-Q or forskolin—aminophylline (to
increase cell CAMP) reduced basal MLC phosphorylation and
prevented an expected increase in MLC phosphorylation fol-
lowing exposure of HUVE cells to histamine. Pretreatment of
HUVE cells with MIL-9 or forskolin-aminophylline prevented
HUVE cell retraction (measured as an increase in permeability
of a monolayer of HUVE cells) in response to histamine. Pre-
treatment of PPAE cells with ML—Q or forskolin-aminophylline
tracellular calcium These data support the hypothesis that
phosphorylation of MLC is an important component of endo-
thelial cell retraction.

INFLAMMATORY EDEMA is associated with separation of
adjacent endothelial cells (2, 4, 15, 17, 19, 24, 25, 28).
Although there are multiple reports documenting this,
the mechanism of cell separation is not well explained.
Agents that chelate calcium and interrupt calcium~
dependent cell-cell and cell—substrate adhesion cause
edema and separation of adjacent endothelial cells (19,
sult from loss of tethering between cells and between
cells and substrate. They also imply that a constitutive
centripetal tension opposes the tethering, and unop-
posed expression of this constitutive tension contributes
to cell retraction when the tethering is released.

Other investigators have suggested that the separa-
tion of adjacent endothelial cells involves initiation or
augmentation. of a centripetal tension that is mediated
by actin and myosin (22, 29). This position is based on
the observation that 100 aM calcium, ATP, myosin
light—chain kinase (MLCK), and calmodulin caused
phosphorylation of the light chain of myosin (MLC) and
contraction of the actin cytoskeleton of endothelial cells

after their cell membranes were removed with detergents
(22, 29, 30).
L606


- tion of human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells,

that this was prevented by pretreatment of the cells with
agents that increased cell adenosine 3',5'-cyclic mono-
phosphate (CAMP), and that the increased CAMP did
not prevent histamine from increasing calcium in the
HUVE cells (4). More recently we found that MLCK
constitutively phosphorylates MLC in HUVE cells (0.21
t 0.02 mol phosphate/mol MLC), that histamine in-
creases MLC phosphorylation (0.19 :l: 0.05 mol
stitutive level of phosphorylation (to 0.06 i 0.02 mol
phosphate/mol MLC) and prevents the increase in
phosphorylation expected after histamine exposure (18).
Although these experiments were consistent with the
idea that CAMP prevented the response to histamine by
preventing MLC‘ phosphorylation, activation of the
CAMP-dependent kinase could also have other effects on
the cytoskeleton of the cells that might contribute to
inhibition of retraction. In the experiments described
in this paper we extend these observations by deter
mining the effects of inhibition of MLC phosphoryla-
tion by two very different mechanisms on the retrac-
tion of endothelial cells in response to an increase in
ing (calcium chelation).

Summary — Nicotine was found to markedly potentiate haloperidol-induced hypokinesia in rats. Nicotine alone
wu without effect. Subsequently. concurrent administration of 2 mg nicotine gum to 10 Toutette syndrome patients
being treated with haloperidol produced a substantial decrease in tics and improvement of concentration and
attention span. Nicotine gum alone was without effect. While 80% of children showed improvement with nicotine
gum, 70% completely discontinued the gum because of side-effects. primarily involving nausea and bitter taste.

Nicotine may prove useful for treating other neuroleptic responsive disorders. such as schizophrenia and

Introduction

Tourette syndrome is a complex disorder invol-
ving long-ten-n motor and vocal tics which is
commonly treated by administration of haloperi-
do]. However. there is now considerable caution
about the long-term use of this neuroleptic,
particularly in view of the risk of later tardive
dysltinesia. In addition, a number of those recei-
ving this medication frequently complain about
the side effects of akathisia. drowsiness, separa-
tion anxiety syndrome and impairment of concen-
tration during schoolwork [4]. It is therefore
important to investigate any agent which could

potentiate the beneﬁcial effects of halcipen'dol,
and thereby reduce the amount of this neuroleptic
needed while retaining the desired effects.
Ideally, such an agent could also increase concen-
tration and attention. given the high comorbidity
of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder with
Tourette disorder. The present paper describes
research demonstrating the potential of nicotine
as an adjunctive therapy with neutoleptics.
Recently, Moss et nl. (IO, 11] demonstrated that
nicotine produced powerful increases in reser-
pine-induced hypokinesia in rats. We were inte-
rested in whether nicotine could also potentiate

ABSTRACT Retroviral transduction of cellular nucleic
acid sequences requires illegitimate RNA or DNA recombina-
tion. To test a model that postulates transduction via efﬁcient
illegitimate recombination during reverse transcription of viral
and cellular RNAs. we have measured the ability of Harvey

We conclude that there is no efficient illegitimate reconthin. -
tion in retroviruses In view of known precedents ofillegilintate
DNA recombination, the structure of known viral one genes,
and our evidence for illegitimate DNA recombination via
provirus lntegratlon. we favor the DNA model of transduction
over the RNA model.

 

Retroviral transduction of oncogenic sequences requires
either RNA— or DNA<mediatcd illegitimate recombination.
“surprisingly efﬁcient" illegitimate recombination by RNA
template switching during reverse transcription (1). the RNA
model is currently favored (1—11). This model holds ll'lill n
retrovirus would integrate upstream of a protomne gene,
spontaneously lose its 3' terminus. or fail to terminate during
transcription (9). and produce a 5' viral-3’ proto-mu' mRNA.
In a second step. the cellular 3' region of this hybrid RNA
would recombine with the nonhontologous 3' region of on
intact (helper) retrovirusduring reverse transcription in order
to obtain a retroviral 3' terminus. A competing DNA model
holds that all steps of rctroviral transduction are mediated by
illegitimate primary DNA recombination (12).

INTRODUCTION

The analysis of volatile nitrosamines in tobacco smoke
(mainstream and sidestream) has been worked out in this

lab using the TEA detector. It is now desirable to have
available a routine procedure for the non-volatile, tobacco—
specific nitrosamines in both processed tobacco and tobacco
smoke. It is also planned to apply this method to indoor
studies and to monitor NINO extracts.

PROCEDURES

A review of the current literature was made and there are
several chromato'raphic methods available : TLCl), GLC2”41
GC-MSS), HPLC6‘8? and HPLC-TEAg). Although the analysis
of NNN is the major goal, it is conceivable to include

 


anatabin (NAtB). The possible presence of the latter was
first mentioned by Klus and Kuhnl) and later confirmed by

It is planned to apply‘GLC, HPLC and HPLC-TEA methods and
to compare the results obtained in addition to the feasi-

gesgltg: An‘U.S. patent application was filed which, among other
claims, covered the use of KHzPO, on high basis weight cigarette

papers.

Sherry Baldwin and Gordon Bokelman visited Dr. Helena Chum, an
Research Institute (SERI) in Golden, Colorado. Prior to the visit
two samples, representing high basis weight cigarette paper with
and without KHzPO, additive, had been submitted for preliminary
analysis on the molecular beam mass spectrometer at SERI. The
results indicated distinctive differences between the samples.
This information may be useful in understanding how paper

impressive. A memo was prepared which gives more details on this
trip and also includes a preliminary proposal for research to be
conducted at SBRI by Dr. Chum's group (1).

Three high basis weight papers made at the U. of Maine and sized
with different levels of thPO, were used to prepare handmade
cigarettes for sidestream analyses. Optimal sidestream reduction
was clearly a function of paper porosity. These models were
designed to provide assistance for commercial development of a low
sidestream paper by Kimberly-Clark.

The examination of a number of different chemical sizings on
medium‘and high basis weight papers was continued. A soluble form
of "ferric" pyrophosphate (probably mixed ferric and ferrous) has
been‘shown to be quite effective for reducing sidestream at
relatively low levels (~3%). Problems with this sizing include a
slight yellow color which is imparted to the paper and the
production of a reddish ash. Further examination of other iron
tetrapotassium pyrophosphate, but at higher levels (7-8%) than the
“ferric" form. High levels of MAP and DAB (13-17%) produced no
significant sidestream reduction and gave very long static burn
times. A combination of Kﬁzcitrate and KHzPO, gave very good

Communicated by Edwin G. Krebs. May 21, 1990
ABSTRACT A number of eukaryotic viruses have evolved
mechanisms to downregulate activity of the interferon-
ferred to as P68 based on its Mr of 68,000 in human cells). This
eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor 2 (eIF-Z), limiting
functional eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor 2 avail-
that inﬂuenza virus encoded in speciﬁc mechanism to repress
the autnphosphorylation and activity of P68. Using in vitra
assays for P68 inhibition, we now have puriﬁed, to near
homogeneity, the P68 repressor from inﬂuenza virus-infected
cells. The puriﬁed product inhibited both the autophosphory-
Iation of P68 as well as phosphorylation of the at subunit of
eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor 2 by the kinase.
We tested for both protease and phosphatase activity but found
neither activity associated with the purified inhibitor. Surpris-
ingly we found the puriﬁed repressor, which had an apparent
Mr of :58,000, was a cellular and not a viral-encoded protein.
Possible mechanisms by which inﬂuenza virus activates this
potential antiviral effects of interferon, are discussed.

 

To avoid decreases in protein synthetic rates during infec-
tion. animal viruses have devised strategies to downregulatc
activity of the interferon-induced, double-stranded RNA—
68,000 but also referred to by others as DAI or P1/elF~2
kinase) (14). The P68, a serine/threonine kinase. is charac—
terized by two distinct kinase activities: the first involves an
autophosphorylation (activation) reaction, and the second
involves a protein kinase activity on exogenous substrates (5,
6). The virus-induced control of P68 is essential because
viral-speciﬁc RNAs synthesized during infection have the
P68 phosphorylntes its natural substrate, the a subunit of
protein synthesis eukaryotic initiation factor 2, ch»2. Phos-
phorylation of the cIF-2 a subunit blocks the eIF-ZB-
mediated exchange of GDP in the inactive cIF-Z—GDP com-
plex with GTP required for catalytic utilization of elF-Z
(12—14). These events lead to limitations in functional eIF-2,
which is an essential component of protein synthesis initia-
tion and is normally required to bind initiator Mct-tRNA (via
the tertiary complex cIF-ZiGTPaMet-IRNA) to the initiating
ribosornal subunit bcl‘orc mRNA is bound (15).

The regulation ol'P68 is best understood in the adenovirus
system primarily because of the characterization of the

payment. This article must therefore be hereby marked "uriverii.mnmi"

mutant, which is deﬁcient in the synthesis ofthc adenovirus—
encoded RNA polymerase 111 product, virus-associated
of P68 and phosphorylation of eIF—Z a subunit (17—22). We
demonstrated that virus—associated RNA 1 functioned to
block the activation of the kinase by forming a complex with
P68 (17). In contrast to adenovirus, both reovirus and vac-
cinia viruses appear to downregulate P68 by encoding gene
products that may bind to and scqucstcr the doubleestranded
RNA activator of the kinasc (23—25). Poliovirus has devised
yet another strategy to minimize the damaging effects of
signiﬁcantly degraded (7). Finally. we recently have shown
that the human immunodeﬁciency Virus HIV-1 may mediate
downregulation ofthc protein kinase via action ofthe lat genc
product (26).

nisms to regulate P68 came from studies analyzing cells
doubly infected with inﬂuenza virus and the adcnovirus
mutant dl331. When mutant dl331-infectcd cells were super-
infected with inﬂuenza virus, dramatic suppression of the
protein kinase activity normally detected during mutant
infection was observed (27). We then reported a similar
suppression of kinase activity in cells infected by inﬂuenza
virus alone (28). In the present report we describe the
purification and characterization of an unusual P68 repressor
from influenza virus-infected cells. The inhibitor, which was
puriﬁed by using in vino P68 inhibition assays, was unex—
pectedly found to be a cellular and not a viral protcin.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cells and Virus. The Madin—Darby bovine kidney (MDBK)
cells (29) and the adenovirus type 5 human embryonic cell
line 293 (30) were grown in monolayers as described (28). The
WSN strain of inﬂuenza virus was grown and titrated as
earlier described (29).

Puriﬁcation of the P68 Inhibitor. Monolayers of MDBK
cells (2 x 1010 cells; 800 T150 ﬂasks) were infected with
inﬂuenza virus at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of le
plaqueeforming units per cell for 4 hr. The infected cells were
washed twice with ice-cold Hunks’ balanced salt solution and
lysed in buffer A: 50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5/50 mM KCl/l mM
dithiothreitol/2 mM MgClz/aprotinin at 100 pg per ml/l. mM
phenylmcthylsulfonyl ﬂuoride/1% Triton X—100. The cyto-
plasmic extracts were then centrifuged at 100,000 X g for 1
hr in a Beckman Ti 70.1 rotor. The supernatant (S100) was
fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation (40—60%).
The ammonium sulfate precipitate was resuspcndcd in buffer

A study has been under way for several months to determine
the maximum amount of propylene glycol we could add toifillers
without staining the paper. BothiAlpine and Philip Morris

cigarettes are being tested - at room temperature and at elevated

temperatures. A range of from 4 ‘to 8% propylene glycol is
being used inithe study. The 8 samples show paper spotting
within a month. The 6% samples show a slight amount of spotting
on Philip Morris cigarettes andifrequent spotting on Alpine ciga-
rettes in 2 months. The h% samples show spotting only at 110°F

Analysis of propylene glycol has been recently made
relatively much more reliable and show much variation in
application of propylene glycol on filler. Therefore future
panel studies will be more meaningful when accompanied by
analytical data. Our studies will continue until firm results

SIMULTANEOUS EVALUATIONS OF FLAVOR AND IRRITATION

We have completed the first of a basic series of studies
on changes of flavor and irritationiwith changes in concentra-
tion of three flavors and of smoke. The four materials selected
to show a wide range of difference in flavor and in irritation,
were furan, aorolein, anethole and whole Philip Morris cigarette
smoke. Sensory evaluation results show strikingly different
patterns for each of these materials with change of concentra-
tion in air dilutions. Furan's flavor increases faster than
does its irritation with increased concentration. By contrast
the reverse is true for acrolein. Irritation increases faster

Lynne J. Weixel Irving Kirsch

Unlike double-blind pharmacological studies, in which subjects
are informed that they will either receive a drug or a placebo,
patients in nonresearch settings are told that they are receiving
medication. Nevertheless, data from double-blind research are used to
evaluate drugs for clinical administration. Thus, it is tacitly
assumed that placebo and drug effects obtained in double-blind
conditions are comparable to those obtained in clinical practice.

expectancy: (l) the subjective probability of having consumed caffeine
and (2) the amount of caffeine that subjects thought they may have
been consumed. Experimental subjects were either led to believe that
they were consuming caffeine (deceptive placebo administration) or
that they might or might not be receiving caffeine (double-blind
placebo administration). In addition, a no—beverage control group
provided a baseline against which placebo effects could be evaluated.
We hypothesized larger placebo effects with deceptive administration
(1985) response expectancy theory, we hypothesized a quadratic effect
as a function of dose. Specifically, we expected to obtain larger
placebo effects at moderate dosages than at small or extreme levels.
Method

In experimental conditions, a single cup of decaffeinated coffee
was brewed in the subject's presence. Apparent dose was manipulated
by using 1, 2, 3, 5, or 8 heaping tablespoons of coffee in preparing
the beverage. In double-blind administration conditions the coffee
was prepared from one of two cans with labels marked "X" and "Y"
respectively. A coin was tossed to determine the can from which the
coffee was selected. Neither subject nor experimenter was aware that
both cans contained decaffeinated coffee. In deceptive administration
conditions the coffee was prepared from a single can bearing the label

of a well-known brand of caffeinated coffee. Control subjects were
asked to wait for twenty minutes.

Before and after beverage consumption, an experimenter who was
unaware of group assignment assessed subjects self-reported mood
(alertness, relaxation, and tension), behavior (digit span, symbol
substitution, reaction time, and rotor pursuit), and physiologic
function (pulse rate and blood pressure). During pre-placebo
assessment, subjects were asked to predict the effect of coffee on the
each of the subjective feelings assessed by the mood scale and also to
predict the effect of coffee on each of the behavioral measures.
Following post-placebo assessment of dependent variables, subjects
were asked to estimate the likelihood that the coffee they had
consumed was caffeinated.

. Results

Between group differences in mood, behavior, and physiological
function were analyzed by means of orthogonal comparisons of mean
residual change scores. Only deceptive administration produced a
significant increase in pulse rate (Figure 1). Significant

ol'their renal effects these peptides have been called atrial
natriuretic factors (ANF). However. recently it has
become clear that AN F also acts on tissues other than the
kidney to regulate blood pressure and intravascular

Cyclin [12 is expressed in embryos and
a striking cellular speciﬁcity of expression was

observed. At both the DNA and protein levels, the predominant sites of cyclin A2 expression were in the germ line stem
cells, the spermatogonia, and in highest levels in preleptotene spermatocytcs, cells in which premciotic DNA synthesis
occurs. The concurrent localization of cyclin A2 mRNA and protein further suggested that cyclin A2 is regulated at the
level of transcription in these cells The observed cellular speciﬁcity of cyclin A2 expression is consistent with its function
during mitosis in the stem cell stage of this lineage, while the restricted meiotic stage localization suggests function in

INTRODUCTION

The mitotic and meiotic divisions of mammalian germ
cells are particularly amenable for study during spermato-
genesis. In the female germ line, many of these events take
place in the embryo and meiosis is interrupted until after
cycle, the meiotic divisions, and the production of haploid
spermatozoa take place, continuously and uninterrupted, in
the adult testis. Analysis of germ cell development in the
male is therefore an excellent system to study both mitotic
and meiotic cell cycles in vivo as well as the mechanisms
that control regulatory checkpoints that are distinct be-
tween the male and female germ line.

Identiﬁcation of many of the gene products involved in
controlling mitotic and meiotic cell cycles of several model
organisms has greatly facilitated our understanding of cell
cycle regulation. Key among these is a serine/threonine pro~

Molecular Consequences of awdbs, A Cell—Autonomous Lethal Mutation

of Drosophi/a Induced by Hybrid Dysgenesis

CHARLES R. DEAROLF,1 NICK TRIPOULAS, JOE BIGGs, AND ALLEN SHEARN
Department of Biology, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland 21218

Accepted May 2, 1,988

The abnowmlm'ng disc locus, which is at salivary gland chromosome position 10OC-D of the Drosophila melanogaster
genome. has been identiﬁed by a recessive lethal mutation, awd’“, induced by hybrid dysgenesis. When homozygous, this
mutation causes abnormal development of the brain, the ovaries, and the larger imaginal discs as described in the
preceding paper (C. R. Dearolf, E. Hersperger, and A. Shearn, 1988, Dev. Biol 129, 159—168). The DNA corre-
sponding to this locus was isolated from a genomic library prepared from awd’“ heterozygotcs by screening with a
P-element probe. The mod” allele resulted from the insertion of a P»element fragment into a gene that encodes an 0.8-kb
length, both of which contain P-element and and sequences. The wild-type owd“ gene transcript is most abundant
during the second and third larval instars but is found at a lower level during every developmental stage as well as in
continuous cell lines, Thus the mod” gene transcript can be detected in normal larvae at a developmental stage long
before defects are expressed in mutant larvae. Moreover, some tissues, for example the salivary gland of nonmutant,
third-instar larvae, contain high levels of this transcript, even though these tissues appear to develop normally in

mutant larvae. @1988 Academic Press, Inc.

INTRODUCTION

The abnormal wing discs (awd) gene of Dmsophila was
identiﬁed in a screen for hybrid-dysgenic late larval/
early pupal lethal mutations (Dearolf et at, 1988). The
most obvious defect caused by mutations at this locus is
the abnormal morphology of wing discs dissected from
homozygous mutant, third—instar larvae. Such discs are
smaller than normal discs of a comparable age, they are
misshapen, and they are incapable of differentiating a
normal inventory of wing structures. Further studies
revealed that the eye-antenna and leg discs are also
affected by the mutation. Although those discs appear
morphologically normal, they are also incapable of dif-
ferentiating a normal inventory of imagine] structures,
In addition to these imaginal disc defects, which were
shown to be cell autonomous, it was observed that
transplanted mutant ovaries were sterile and that the
mutant central nervous system was histologically ab—
normal (Dearolf, 1986; Dearolf et at, 1988).

The developmental consequences caused by the 41de
lethal mutation provided some inferences about the
normal requirements for the product of the gene
bryogenesis and early larval development the mud"

normal larval development the awn?” gene is required in

the wing disc as well as in the brain, and that somewhat
later in development it is required in the eye—antenna
and leg discs and the ovary.

However, the normal pattern of gene transcription
cannot necessarily be determined from the analysis of
the developmental consequences of mutations
(McKeown et al., 1987; Hartley et at, 1987). In order to
determine the pattern of gene transcription for owd, we
have isolated both genomic DNAs and cDNAs which
correspond to the awd gene, analyzed the pattern of
accumulation of the owd+ transcript during normal de-
velopment, and analyzed the effect of the mod” muta-
tion on that pattern. These results considerably extend
what was inferred about the expression of the awd gene
from studying the developmental consequences of mu-
tations in the gene and have provided the foundation for
identifying the awd protein.

pregnancy in the rat. Among such disruptive effects are increased frequency of
fetal resorption, reduced litter size and weight, and delayed parturition. The
primary objective of the experiments embodied in this study is to gain a greater

 

normal course of pregnancy, and more particularly, how the chief alkaloid of tobacco
reduces litter size and delays parturition. To this end, a variety of parameters
will be measured to assess reproductive efficiency, time of implantation, fetal

growth and development, and normalcy of parturition in nicotine-treated vs.

Several experimentally testable hypotheses are proposed. Specifically,
experiments will be conducted to determine if nicotine—induced reduction in litter
size and delay in parturition are related to alterations in uterine sensitivity
to implantation. The time of onset, magnitude and duration of sensitivity to
decidualization will be compared in treated and control rats. In addition, the

effects of nicotine on duration of gestation will be determined by an accurate
measurement of the time of parturition.

Recent experiments have demonstrated that both the development of the
preimplantation'blastocyst and the time of zona pellucida loss are delayed in
nicotine-treated rats. Experiments are in progress to assess: (l) the magnitude
of the delay, (2) the hormonal conditions under which it occurs, and (3) various
aspects of the intrauterine environment.

A study relating the intralesional inﬁltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells to patient survival was

was designated the “high lymphocytic” group. An equivalent number of cases with fewer lymphocytes
comprised the “low lymphocytic” group. The survival rate at 15 years was 36.7% for patients in the high
lymphocytic group and 69.6% for patients in the low lymphocytic group. Using the Cox model, the authors
found that an increased number of lymphocytes per 20 HPF was signiﬁcantly associated with decreased
survival (chi-square = 21.2, P = <0.l][|l]1). A signiﬁcant association was observed even when we controlled

for other risk factors (chi—square = 6.98, P = 0.008).

most cancerous tumors. In succeeding publicationsf‘4
contradictory results were presented regarding this asso-

patients with uveal malignant melanoma, Davidorf and

lymphocytic inﬁltration was either poorly deﬁned or sub

description of our proposed studies (based on hypotheses that are put forward from our ongoing research)
and the speciﬁc aims of the proposal.

Subgroup 1 receptor tyrosine kinases-The subclass 1 growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (1)
include the epidermal growth factor (EGF) rece tor, the neu/erbB2 tyrosine kinase (also designated
HERZ), the erbB3 protein (HER3), and the erbB (protein (HER4). Each of these proteins appear to be
comprised of a single olypeptide chain (Mr ~ 17 —180 kDa) that includes a cysteine-rich extracellular
domain that contains a number of potential autophosphorylation sites. The ﬁrst important step in the
activation of tyrosine kinase activity. An immediate outcome of this activation event is the
autophosphorylation of the rece tor which in turn serves to recruit cellular phosphosubstrates and initiate
signaling cascades that lead to t e nucleus. It has now been well establishe that roteins that contain the
src—homology region 2 (SH—2 domains) bind to the autophosphorylated growt factor rece tors. An
emanate from a given receptor, as well as to identify other proteins that participate in these signaling
pathways and determine how these pathways are integrated to give a biological (growth) response.

Relevance of subgroup 1 receptor tyrosine kinases to lung cancer-

A number of lines of evidence have implicated subclass 1 receptors in different t pes of cancer. For
example, the am lification of the neu/erbBZ tyrosine kinase has been found in 15—40 0 of primary breast
carcinomas and 0% of ovarian carcinomas and appears to have a signiﬁcant redictive value for the
overall survival of patients with breast cancer (2). In various lung cancers, bot the EGF receptor and
neu/erbBZ have been found to be overexpressed (3,4). The presence of the EGF receptor to a significantly
eater extent in non-small-cell lung cancer and squamous carcinomas com ared to non—squamous tumors
3) has been demonstrated. The levels of EGF receptor were related to e sta e of spread of the lung
tumors. In fact, the demonstration of a high concentration of EGF receptor in e worst prognosis non-
small-cell lung cancer led to the suggestion that this receptor, or components of its signaling pathway,
neu/erbBZ tyrosine kinase in lung cancers is of potential prognostic importance (4). Expression of
neu/erbBZ occurs in both squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas of the lung and at higher levels
than in uninvolved bronchiolar epithelium; moreover, in adenocarcinomas, the expression of neu/erbB2 is
independently associated with a shortened survival.

Mechanisms of receptor activation and aberrant signaling-

Obviously a key question concerns how the overexpression (or amplification) of these receptor
tyrosine kinases leads to uncontrolled cell growth. The detection of normal basal mucosal stainin in the
lun for EGF receptor (3) led to the suggestion that these stem cells of the mucosa may re uire GP for
pro iferation and differentiation to normal mucosal cells. If EGF receptor activity, and or neu/erbB2
activity, were necess for the normal growth of lung cells, then events that result in the overexpression
of these receptors con (1 elicit an overampllification of a growth signaling pathwap and thereb initiate

e have obtained evidence for another type of heterodimer formation, specificall between
neu/erbBZ and the erbB3 protein (6). These studies were initiated because of the ﬁndings that e putative
ligand (growth factor) for neu/erbB2, designated heregulin (also called neu differentiation factor) (7),
could bind to neu/erbBZ in some cells (cg. mammary carcinomas) but not all cells (ﬁbroblasts). Given

1. Non-burning smoking article:

Additional work on this subject was done this month by examining the
filtration effect of a cellulose acetate filter versus no filter. The
sample examined was an IFF tobacco neutral fraction flavor. Fifty
microliters of the sample were applied to a piece of filter paper inside a
plastic tube like those used by Flavor Development for the non-burning
smoking article. Thirty-five ml puffs were withdrawn alternately at one end
containing a CA filter and at the other end, which was open. The results of
chromatograms produced by samples taken in these ways showed that the later,
more polar, less volatile components are reduced disproportionately when
puffed through the CA filter compared to a sample taken with no filter.
This observation could have implications for the use of tobacco-identical
flavors in both burning and non-burning smoking products, since this flavor

2. Setup of an electron capture detector:

this work the lower limits of detectability of Lindane and Aldrin were
explored and more difinitively determined. It was found that approximately

300-400 femtograms (10-13 grams) of either pesticide could be detected at a
2:1 signal to noise ratio, but about half this amount could not. A minimum

of 15 picograms of each of the pesticides were detected in 3 microliters of
a bright tobacco extract. The accuracy of the concentration of the
pesticide standard being used was compared with a completely separate
standard of Lindane, and the amounts from each source were found to be
equal within normal experimental variability.

A memo concerning this work is being written, and no further work
will be done in this area unless a need arises.

Expression of the Transcription Factor NFATp in a Neuronal Cell

(Received for publication, March 30, 1994, and in revised form, August 8, 1994)

Andrew M. Hui, Jugnu Jain§11, Anjana Rao§1L and Patrick G. Hoganil

From the igDepartment of Neurobiology, Harvard Medical School, the §Division of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Dana

The transcription factor NFATp, which has a central
role in cytokine gene induction in T cells, was previously
thought to be expressed only in T cells and other im-
mune cells. Here we report that NFATp is also expressed
in the rat PCIZ pheochromocytoma cell line and in the
murine nervous system. Antisera against T cell NFATp
recognize proteins of similar apparent molecular weight
in T cells, PC12 cells, and murine olfactory bulb. The
immunoreactive proteins from PC12 cells and from 01-
factory bulb bind to an NFAT site of the murine inter-
leukin-2 promoter with the same speciﬁcity as T cell
NFATp. Immunohistochemical staining localizes NFATp
to neurons, speciﬁcally to olfactory receptor neurons
and to their terminals in the olfactory bulb. The pres-
ence of NFATp in the nervous system suggests that it has
a role in the transcription of specific neuronal genes in
response to increases in cytosolic calcium.

____________-.———————

The transcription factor NFATp is essential for transcription
of cytokine genes in activated T cells (177). NFATp cooperates
with F05 and Jun family proteins in the nucleus of stimulated
T cells to activate transcription of the interleukin-2 (IL-2)‘ gene
(8—11) and acts in concert with these or other transcription fac—
tors to increase transcription of other cytokine genes (3, 4, 6, 12),
of the inducible nuclear factor NFAT [8, 1.2915); its activation in
T cells depends on a calcium/calmodulin/calcineurin signaling
pathway and is sensitive to cyclosporin A and FK506 (15, 16).
NFATp is a phosphoprotein of apparent molecular mass ~120
kDa (11, 15, 17), which exists in T cells as several isoforms aris-
ing from alternatively spliced mRNA transcripts [18).

A nuclear factor similar or identical to NFATp has also been
identiﬁed in B cells (2, 1%21). Extracts ofunstimulated B cells
contain factors that bind to the distal NFAT site of the lL-2
promoter and form a complex on this site with F03 and Jun
family proteins (19). As in T cells, the activation of NFAT is
initiated by an increase in cytoplasmic calcium and is pre—
vented by treatment of the cells with cyclosporin A (20, 21).
Antisera against T cell NFATp recognize the protein—DNA com-
plexes from B cells2 and identify proteins comparable in appar<
ent molecular weight to T cell NFATp in Western analysis ofB
cell proteins.” Recent work has documented the presence of

multimer of the NFAT site was restricted almost entirely to

On the other hand the components of the Culciuxn’calmodulin/

expressed by the P012 cell line, a rat adrenal chromaﬂin tumor

signaling, transcriptional regulation, and neuronal differentia-

tively high levels in the murine olfactory bulb, largely in ter»

The c—fos gene belongs to the family of growth- and differentiation-related
immediate early genes whose expression, in vivo and in vitro, represents the first
measurabie response to a variety of chemical and physicai stimuli including
tumor promoters and DNA-damaging agents. The expression of c-fos has been
identified as a signal for cell proliferation, but also for apoptosis.

Key Findings:

c-fos expression in quiescent 3T3 ﬁbrobiast cells

concentration-dependently. A threshold concentration of approx. 0.015
puffsiml was observed.

by interfering with transcriptionai and posttranscriptional regulatory
components since a slight induction of the c—fos promoter and a strong
stabilization of c-fos transcripts were observed. The translation of smoke-
bubbled PBS-induced c-fos mRNA into protein was conﬁrmed using immuno-

detection methods.

reaction since neither o-phenanthroline - an efﬁcient, membrane permeable
scavenger of iron cations - nor catalase were able to reduce cigarette smoke-
dependent c—fos expression at concentrations that were shown to inhibit DNA

strand break formation.

Title of Original Grant: Modulation of nicotine-receptor channels
Abstract of the Speciﬁc Aims as stated in the original application:

Aim 1: Modulation of post synaptic nicotineﬁgtivated channels subtypes,

Aim 1 of the original application proposed to asess the differences amongst native neuronal nAChR
subtypes with respect to which subtypes are subject to modulation and which nAChR (1 subunits are
required for modulation. We proposed to examine the single channel properties and modulation of
nAChRs on primary neurons and then compare the behaviour of native nAChRs with those expressed by
"subunit deleted“ neurons (is. neurons treated with subunit-speciﬁc antisense oligonucleotides). This
analysis was to be complemented by studies of the modulation of nicotine activated channels made up of
particular on and B nAChR subunit cDNAs, expressed in Xenopus oocytes.

' :Rl fr nalnl ' recetrsinth tinofsn tic

Experiments in Aim 2 were to examine the role of presynaptic nicotine receptor channels in the
modulation of synaptic function. Our preliminary experiments suggested that nicotine might augment the
release of fast excitiatory transmitters. We proposed that different subtypes of nAChRs might mediate
nicotine-induced synaptic facilitation, perhaps dependent on the targetting of speciﬁc subtypes to terminal
ﬁelds receiving co-incident cholinergic input. Aim 2 experiments proposed to extend our preliminary
ﬁndings by examination of both the molecular mechanism(s) and nicotine receptor subtypes responsible
for synaptic modulation in the CNS.

Title of Original Grant: Nicotine and Its Direct Inhibitory Action in the Rat Septal Nuclei

analyze in detail the membrane mechanisms by which nicotine activates a specific nicotinic receptor on septal
neurons to yield inhibition.

A) Since nicotine hyperpolarizes directly dorsolateral septal neurons, we need to determine: the
characteristics of the receptor responsible; the ionic species and channel to which this receptor is
coupled; and whether nicotine may also alter ion channels localized within the postsynaptic membrane
that are not coupled to this nicotinic receptor.

II) We will determine how nicotine modulates synaptic transmission as recorded within our septal slice
preparation, namely: 1) excitatory acid mediated excitatory transmission and 2) GAIIA mediated
actions.
C) We will determine how nicotine interacts with several substances that we or others have demonstrated
have biological activity within the septum. These substances are endogenous transmitters or
modulators, e.g., serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, somatostatin, etc; or drugs, e.g., barbiturates,
benzodiazepines, alcohol, etc.

1)) Finally, using freshly dissociated septal neurons with patch clamp methodology we will examine the
specific channels opened by nicotine and determine which, if any second-messenger systems may be
associated with CNS nicotinic receptor activation.

Some notes on K-ras mutations in lung cancer

The K-ras signal transduction pathway helps regulate proliferation, apoptosis, and
differentiation, all of which are aberrant in cancer. The K-ras gene contains three mutation
hotspots which occur at codons 12, 13, and 59-61, and a single point mutation at these
an important early stage genetic change in adenocarcinoma of the lung, but rarely occur
in squamous cell carcinomas. K-ras mutations appear to be an independent prognostic
factor indicating a poor prognosis, independent of stage and histology.

Most studies suggest that K-ras mutations occur in about 30% of lung adenocarcinomas
in smokers, but are seldom present in adenocarcinomas from nonsmokers. Few K-ras
nonsmokers exposed to radon. Keohavong et al. (Clin. Cancer Res., 2, 411-418, 1996)
reported 43 (33.9%) of 173 human lung tumors from a U.S. population to contain codon
12, 13 and 61 mutations. Of these, 41 (32%) of 127 adenocarcinomas contained
mutations compared to only 1 squamous carcinoma (2.7%) and 1 adenosquamous
carcinoma (11%); 24 of 40 codon 12 mutations consisted of G—eT transversions, 12 G—>A
transitions, 2 G—>C transversions, and 1 double GG—>TT mutation. Two G—>T
Husgafvel-Pursiainen et al. (Int. J. Cancer, 53, 250-256, 1993) reported 14 (29%) of 48
Finish lung cancer cases to have K-ras mutations, of these 12 (57%) of 21
adenocarcinoma contained mutations in codons 12, 13 and 61. In a Dutch study, Slebos
et al. (N. Engl. J. Med., 323, 561-565, 1990) reported 19 (27.5%) of 69 adenocarcinomas
to have K—ras mutations .

K-ras mutations have also been suggested to occur in a significant number of squamous
cell carcinomas. Rosell et al. (Clin. Cancer Res, 2, 1083-1086, 1996) have reported 57
(20.7%) of 275 consecutively treated Spanish stage l-lV NSCLCs patients had K-ras
mutations in codons 12 and 61. Of these, 20 (26%) of 78 adenocarcinomas, 29 (18%) of
163 squamous cell carcinomas, and 8 (23.5%) of large cell undifferentiated carcinomas
had K-ras mutations. Codon 12 mutations occurred in 53 (93%) of 57 tumors and were
characterized by 14 coding changes from wild-type glycine (GGT) to valine (GTT), 13 to
aspartic acid (GAT), 10 to cysteine (TGT), 8 to serine (AGT), 6 to arginine (CGT) and a
single change to alanine (GCT). Only 3 (7%) of 57 K-ras mutations occurred at codon 61.

Most published studies have specifically investigated K-ras mutations in codon 12,
because these are the most frequently detected ras mutations in adenocarcinoma of the
lung. Analyzing only codon 12 mutations, Shiono et al. (Carcinogenesis, 17, 1683-1686,
1996) reported 10 (19%) of 53 adenocarcinomas in Japanese males and 2 (4%) of 51
adenocarcinomas in Japanese females to contain K-ras mutations. Of the 12 K-ras
mutations, 7 (58%) were G—>T transversion, 3 (25%) were G—>A transitions and 2 (17%)

were G—>C transversions. Determining only codon 12 mutations results in a slight, but
probably not significant, underestimation of the total frequency of K-ras mutations in lung

tumors.

Mutational activation of the K-ras gene is a rare event in most chemically-induced rat lung

Nested Discontinuity — Gabriel Kaufmann

NESTED DISCONTINUITY: A MODEL FOR LAGGING DNA STRAND SYNTHESIS

1. Synopsis

Three genetically distinct DNA polymerases, pols a, 6 and e,
are implicated in eucaryotic chromosome replication. Yet how
model based on studies with a soluble SV40 replication system,
pol a—primase synthesizes Okazaki pieces and also initiates
replication at the origin. Leading strand elongation is delegated
to pol 6 (2-4). This model assigns no function to pol 5 nor
explains how sequence fidelity is maintained without a proof—
reading function in the lagging strand DNA polymerase.

The notion that lagging strand DNA synthesis is mediated
solely by pol a—primase has been questioned by us. We proposed
instead that an Okazaki piece arises by ligation of shorter
precursor chains and that two DNA polymerases partake in its
synthesis (5,6). According to this Nested Discontinuity Model
(ref. 6, Fig. 7), pol a-primase synthesizes RNA primers (iRNA)
Several DNA primers assemble then into an Okazaki piece in a
pol e and ligation. A mature Okazaki piece joins then onto a
growing long chain. These conclusions are based on two types of
evidence: a) the ability to distinguish between synthesis of DNA
primers and their conversion into Okazaki pieces with specific
DNA. Thus, pol a—specific agents such as BuPdGTP (7) and pol a-
specific monoclonal antibodies selectively inhibit DNA primer
synthesis. In contrast, COMDP, which inhibits pol 6 or pol 6
with greater potency than pol a (8,9), slows down the synthesis
of Okazaki pieces without affecting DNA primer synthesis (our
unpublished results). We have also demonstrated that DNA primers
configure on the lagging template as a contiguous— or near—
contiguous array by enzymatic manipulations of isolated
replicating SV40 DNA, using Klenow polymerase, MMTV reverse
transcriptase and T4 DNA ligase (5 and our unpublished results).

2. Outline of plans and goals of the proposed research
our goal is to test the basic tenets of the Nested
Discontinuity Model. Specific issues addressed are the order of
involved in these steps. Regarding the first issue We consider
two opposing scenarios. In one, DNA primers are deposited
throughout the Okazaki range prior to further processing steps of
iRNA removal, gap—filling and ligation (serial mechanism).
Alternatively, processing closely follows deposition (parallel
mechanism). We also ask what are the polarities of deposition
and processing. Our unpublished results suggest a 5' to 3' order
parallel mechanism. A serial mechanism is compatible with
processing in either polarity (see also Fig. 1). Regarding the
second issue we ask which DNA polymerase, 6 or e, catalyzes gap
filling; which DNA ligase, I or II, catlyzes DNA primer ligation
and whether the same enzyme ligates Okazaki pieces.

continuously monitored esophageal (Pea) and gastric (Pga)
model to estimate instantaneous diaphragmatic (DIA), inspir-
pressures at various times during inspiration. We validated our
system (Vrc-Pga and Vab-Pga, where Vrc and Vab are the rib
cage and abdominal volumes, respectively) as well as electro-
myography of the respiratory muscles. Measurements were
subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPDs)
and S age-matched normal subjects (AMNs). AMNs were 59 i
2 (SE) yr and had a forced expiratory volume at 1 s (FEVLO) of
3.6 t 0.2 liters; COPDs were 66 i 2 yr and had a FEVm of 1.0
i 0.1 liters. We noted the following. At rest, both AMNs and
COPDs exhibited an increasing DIA pressure (Pm/I) across
inspiratory time (T1) at rest. As expired minute ventilation
increased with exercise intensity, AM his continued to maintain
this Pun ramp across inspiration; in contrast, COPDs exhibited
higher values of PD”, during the ﬁrst half of TI than during the
second half. At all intensities of exercise, COPDs exhibited
higher 1AM and PER pressures than the AMNs.

diaphragmatic mechanics; ventilatory muscle fatigue; treadmill
exercise

FOR OVER A CENTURY, previous workers have attempted

cle groups to ventilation at rest and during exercise (4).
In 1976, Grimby, Goldman, and Mead (9) studied thor-
acoabdominal volume-pressure changes in normal hu-
mans and concluded that at rest the diaphragm was the
only importantly active inspiratory muscle. During in-
creasing intensities of bicycle exercise, they observed
thoracoabdominal volume—pressure changes, which they
interpreted as reﬂecting increased activity of the inspir-
atory accessory muscles (IAM) and expiratory muscles.
Grimby, Goldman, and Mead (9) hypothesized that ex~
piratory increases in abdominal pressure represented the
storage of elastic and gravitational energy in the chest
wall at end expiration; at the beginning of the next
inspiration, relaxation of the expiratory muscles would
release this energy and thereby facilitate inspiratory

888

airﬂow.

More recently, Dodd, Brancatisano, and Engel (6)
ments to evaluate the contributions of various ventila-
tory muscle groups to inspiration in patients with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) during bicycle
exercise. They hypothesized that postexpiratory recoil
(PER) of the abdominal wall resulted in rapid diaphragA
matic descent, outward movement of the rib cage, and
contraction of the abdominal muscles during expiration
tended to preserve diaphragmatic length for the initia-
tion of the subsequent inspiration. However, neither
Grimby et al. (9) nor Dodd et al. (6) attempted to describe
the instantaneous pressures generated by the different
ventilatory muscle groups throughout inspiration.

Macklem and co-workers (2, 3, 13, 14) ﬁrst introduced
esophageal pressure-gastric pressure (Pes-Pga) relation—
ships to infer the contributions of the diaphragm (DIA),
IAM, and PER to inspiratory muscle pressure generation
by a direct graphic method, and showed that this analytic
approach was useful in a qualitative assessment of ven-
tilatory muscle coordination during breathing under dif-
ferent circumstances. Despite the extensive studies of
Macklem and co—workers (2, 3, 13, 14), these authors did
not attempt to quantitate the instantaneous pressures
generated by different ventilatory groups throughout in—
spiration.

In the present study, we use a three—component model
of inspiratory pressure generation to estimate instanta-
neous DIA, 1AM, and PER pressures at various times
during inspiration. We present these estimates for 11
COPD subjects (COPDs) and 8 age-matched normal
subjects (AMNs) during rest and various intensities of
treadmill exercise. We include ventilatory muscle elec-
tromyograms (EMGs) as well as the relationships be-
tween changes in thoracoabdominal displacements and
respiratory pressures (9) to validate the conclusions
drawn from our model of inspiratory pressure generation.

lg vitro lipid peroxidation of red blood cells has been studied
using high glucose (55.5 mM) in the media to stimulate lipid
peroxidation. Vitamins A, C and E in a natural matrix and a
citrus extract reduced lipid peroxidation as measured by
thiobarbituric acid reactivity. A human supplementation study
was done in which it was shown that natural vitamin C containing
ascorbic acid and citrus extract significantly elevated lipid
peroxidation in both plasma and urine. Citrus extract alone
decreased plasma lipid peroxidation. Natural vitamin A and E
decreased both plasma and urine lipid peroxidation. A

combination of natural vitamins A, E and citrus extract was the

most effective supplement resulting in more than a 30% decrease
in both plasma and urine lipid peroxidation.

Infections with Shiga toxin-producing Shigella dysenteriae type 1 and Shiga-like toxin (SLT)«producing
Escherichia coli cause outbreaks of bloody diarrhea in which patients are at risk for developing life-threatening
complications involving the renal and central nervous systems. Histopathology studies and in vitro experi-
ments suggested that the toxins damage toxin receptor~expressing endothelial cells (EC) lining glomerular and
central nervous system capillaries. In the presence ofinduciblc host factors (cytokines), EC sensitivity to SLT
toxicity was increased ~l million-fold. We hypothesized that to manifest the vascular lesions characteristic of
infection with toxin-producing bacteria, two signals were needed: systemic toxins am} elevated proinﬂamma-
tory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-u], interleukin 1 [IL-1], and IL-6). Human EC do not secrete
these cytokines when stimulated with SILTs in vitro, suggesting that additional cells may be involved in
pathogenesis. Therefore. we carried out comparative analyses of the capacity of puriﬁed (endotoxjn-free) SLTs
and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) to induce cytokine mRNA and proteins from murine macrophages. The cells
LPS induced TNF activity and IL-6 expression from macrophages, although dose response and kinetics of
cytokine induction differed. LPS was a more effective inducing agent than SLTs. SLT-I-induced TNF activity
and IL-6 expression were delayed compared with induction mediated by LPS. lL-lot production required ~24
h of exposure to SLTs or LPS. Macrophages from LPS-hyporesponsive C3H/HeJ mice produced low levels of
TNF activity when treated with SLT-l, suggesting that LPS and SLTs may utilize separate signaling pathways

for cytokine induction.

Infections with Shigella dysenterine type 1 or enterohemor-
rhagic Escherichia coli are associated with outbreaks of bacil-
lary dysentery or hemorrhagic colitis, respectively. Patients
with these bloody diarrhea] diseases are also at increased risk
for the development of life~threatening complicaticms involv-
sequelae. the hemolytic—uremic syndrome (HUS), is a major
cause of pediatric acute renal failure. .5. dyiente‘n’ae type I
expresses high levels of a potent cytotoxin called Shiga toxin.
toxins which are collectively referred to as Shiga-like toxins
(SLTs) or verocytotoxins. Serologic and nucleotide sequencing
analyses showed that SLTs may be classiﬁed on the basis of
their antigenic and genetic relationship to Shiga toxin (re
viewed in reference 42); SLT type I (SLT-I) is virtually
identical to Shiga toxin. while SLT-ll is ~56% homologous to
Shiga toxin or SLT—I at the deduced amino acid sequence level.
Although genetic variants of the toxins have been described.
extensive biochemical and biologic studies have shown that all
members of the SLT family are A85 holotoxins which act by
inhibiting eukaryotic protein synthesis and utilize the neutral
glycolipids globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) or globotetraosylcen
amide (Gb4) as functional receptors (reviewed in references
10: 35, and 42).
The precise role of the toxins in colonic ulceration and
bloody diarrhea or in the development of postdiarrhcal sys-
temic complications is not known. Comparative histopathoi
logic examination of tissues from macaque monkeys fed either

genie isogenic derivative suggested that Shiga toxin may exac-
erbate disease by speciﬁcally damaging capillaries serving the
colonic mucosa and by mediating the inﬂux of inﬂammatory
cells into the intestinal compartment (17). Examination of
characterized by the swelling and detachment of glomerular
endothelial cells (EC) from the basement membrane accom-
panied by the deposition of microthrombi and inﬂux of in-
ﬂammatory cells into the glomeruli (4o, 47). Rabbits given
intravenous SLTs developed severe edema and pctechial hem-
orrhages in the cecal mucosa and widespread thrombotic
microangiopathy, edema, and ischemic necrosis in the brain
and spinal cord. Macrophages were occasionally found in the
damaged tissues (4, 48, 65). Mice given SL’l‘s developed acute
damage and expression of Gb; were directly correlated (55.
61). Taken together, these data support the concept that the
toxins act in vivo to speciﬁcally damage Gbyexpressing cells in
target organs. EC damage may then facilitate the exudation of
neutrophils and monocytes into the affected tissues,

Shiga toxin and SLTs were shown to be directly toxic for
human vascular EC in vitro (43, 58), although the doses of
toxin necessary to manifest EC killing were 105 to 10“ times
greater than the doses used to lyse toxin—sensitive cell lines
such as Vero or HeLa cells. We and others have found,
however, that when EC were incubated in the presence of
bacterial endotoxins or the proinﬂammatory cytokines tumor
necrosis factorn (TNF-or) and interleukin-l (ILvl). they were
markedly sensitized to the cytotoxic action of SLTs (33, 34, 58).
The mechanism of cytokine—mediated toxin sensitization may
involve increased synthesis and membrane expression of Gb3
(59). Barrett ct al. (3) demonstrated that TNF activity could be
elicited from murine macrophages by treatment with puriﬁed

1. Backggound and Signiﬁcance.
T lymphocytes play a vital role in the defense against viral and bacterial

invaders as well as malignant cells that arise from host tissues. The biochemical
respond to a variety of different extracellular stimuli to mount an effective immune
response. For example, this can take the form of localizing to a speciﬁc area of
infected or inﬂamed tissues. Recognition of speciﬁc antigen by the T cell receptor as
well as ligand binding to other so-called "accessory" receptors can also stimulate
lymphocyte activation leading to cell proliferation. lymphokine secretion and
ampliﬁcation of the immune response. Thus, a more thorough understanding of the
ways in which lymphocytes communicate with their extracellular milieu is of
profound importance to our knowledge of the workings of the cellular immune
system. Moreover, such knowledge can potentially lead to the rational design of
therapeutic interventions which could either amplify or dampen this response.

Over the past several years. my laboratory has focused on studying a T cell
toxin (PT). The exotoxin of Bordetella pertussis is a member of a group of bacterial
towns that are structurally composed of two functional subunits. The “A" subunit
covalent modification of substrate proteins by the addition of an ADP-ribosyl moiety
utilizing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide [NADl as the donor. The substrates for
this reaction are GTP<binding "G" proteins which couple intracellular second
messenger generating systems to membrane receptor signalling. PT is known to
ADP-ribosylate the alpha subunits of a number of G proteins belonging to the G1

class. including G151 and Gpa, as well as transducin in vertebrate photoreceptors.
The “B" subunit of these toxins is thought to facilitate binding to the plasma
membrane via specific receptor sites and to allow entry of the toxin into the
intracellular compartment. In most cells. the effects of PT require a prolonged pre—

systems, treatment of the toxin with reducing agents is necessary to produce its
enzymatic activity. presumably by reducing intrachain disulﬁde bonds.

In T lymphocytes PT stimulates cell activation, including the generation of
second messengers such as diacylglycerol. increases in intracellular Ca2+. and
tyrosine protein phosphorylation. resulting in cell proliferation. These effects of the
expression of the CD3-T cell antigen receptor complex. suggesting that. like other so—
called "accessory" mitogenic signalling receptors on T cells. the PTR stimulates cells
by activating the T cell receptor (1). We have shown that the B subunit binds to a 43
kDa T cell plasma membrane protein, suggesting that this is the receptor that
mediates the mitogenic effects of the toxin (2). It has been unclear whether the toxin
receptor(s) is a novel protein or has been previously identified as something else. One
possible. although unlikely. candidate that we considered was the CD38 antigen. a

Schoendorf and Kiely {1992)

The ﬁrst study to independently examine maternal smoking during and after pregnancy

. was published by Schoendorf and Kiely (1992). They performed a case-control analysis of
data from the 1988 National Maternal and Infant Health Survey. Within this dataset, 201
black and 234 white autopsied SIDS cases were identiﬁed from death certiﬁcates;
cigarette consumption during pregnancy and at the time of interview, and from their
responses categorized as nonsmokers, smokers after pregnancy only, or smokers during
and aﬁer pregnancy. After adjustment for maternal age, education, and marital status.
maternal smoking only aﬁer pregnancy had an OR of 1.8 (CI 1.0, 3.0) for whites and 2.3
(CI =1.5, 3.7) for blacks. The risk of SIDS among infants of women who smoked both
during and after pregnancy was 3.1 (CI =23, 4.2) and 3.1 (CI =2.2, 4.3) for whites and
blacks respectively. The 0R5 for "passive" (postnatal) and “combined" (pre- and
postnatal) exposure were not directly comparable, as mothers who smoked during and
after pregnancy tended to smoke more cigarettes per day than mothers who smoked only
after pregnancy. The authors also examined the risk of SIDS in relation to the presence of
other smokers in the household. In whites, household smoking was signiﬁcantly
associated with SIDS (OR=1.4, CI=1.0, 1.9), but no relationship was seen in blacks
(OR=O.9, CI 0.7, 1.3). This latter analysis controlled for mother's smoking status only.


Final results from the New Zealand case-control study were published in Mitchell et al.
(1993). The study‘s catchment area covered 78% of all live births in New Zealand during
the 3-year study period. Four hundred eighty-ﬁve SIDS cases were compared to 1,800
who had smoked in the two weeks prior to interview (OR=4.1, CI=3.3, 5.1). The OR
decreased to 1.7 (CI=1.2, 2.3) but was still signiﬁcant at the p=0.05 level after adjusting

for: region, season, breastfeeding, and bed sharing; mother's marital status, socioeconomic

OBJECT:

To report a conversation at the 18th Tobacco Chemists' Research
Conference and subsequent information concerning a papaya cigarette.

SUMMARY:

Information concerning a cigarette made of papaya leaves was
obtained through conversation with a man from Roswell Park Memorial
Institute. This information has been verified and documented.

MEMORANDUM:

During the course of the banquet at the 18th Tobacco Chemists'
Research Conference, Mr. Raymond J. Shamberger of Roswell Park
"first tobacco cigarette in over a year." Subsequent conversation
revealed that he had been employed by a Los Angeles firm as a . .
This firm is backed by several very wealthy movie stars. The
cigarette is to be marketed within a few months through the Frito-

Lay Corporation which is a nationwide distributor of food stuffs,
particularly potato chips and Fritos.

Within the past year Mr. Shamberger was employed by Roswell
Park Memorial Institute as a biochemist. He is one of a staff of

about 20 assigned to work on the question of tobacco and health.
Apparently studies of the papaya cigarette were (or are) also made
at Roswell Park.
(Standard and Poor, September 18, 1964) showed its relation to
Sutton Research Corporation of Los Angeles "to conduct and evaluate
consumers‘ tests and technical research on a non-tobacco cigarette

made from papaya leaves. Frito-Lay has option to acquire 51% of
Sutton.”

Xenograft Model of Progressive Human

Proliferative Breast Disease

Background: Progression of proliferative breast disease
has been associated with increased risk for development
of invasive carcinoma. Cell lines have been developed to
facilitate the study of this process. Human cell line
MCFIDA originated from spontaneous immortalization of
breast epithelial cells obtained from a patient with
ﬁbrocystic disease, and cell lines MCFIOAueoN and
MCFIOAneoT were created by stable transfection of
these cells with the neomycin-resistance gene and either
the HRAS gene or the mutated T-24 HRAS gene, re-
spectively. Purpose: Our goal was to develop an
experimental model of progressive human proliferative
breast disease. Methods: MCFIDA, MCF10AneoN, and
MCF10AneoT cells were injected subcutaneously into the
dorsal ﬂank of male nude/beige (C57/BALB/c nu/nu bg/
bg) mice (12 mice for each cell type). These mice were
examined periodically for formation and persistence or
growth of palpable nodules. One mouse per group was
killed 1 week after cell injection; thereafter, mice were
observed as long as possible. Cells were recovered from
palpable lesions by enzymatic dissociation of the excised
week-14 tumor (MCF10AneoT.TGl) were injected into
12 male nude/beige mice. Southern blot hybridization
analysis of the HRAS gene locus and cytogenetic analyses
were performed. Results: Transplanted MCFIOA and
MCFIOAneoN cells formed transient, small palpable
nodules that regressed and disappeared during the 4th
and 5th weeks. In 10 of the 12 mice, T-24 HRAS gene-
transfected MCFIOA cells (MCFIOAneoT) formed small,
flat nodules that persisted for at least 1 year. Three of
these xenografts became carcinomas. One (removed 7
weeks after transplantation) was an undifferentiated
carcinoma composed of polygonal cells with large,
vesicular nuclei and numerous mitoses. The second
(removed after 14 weeks) was an invasive squamous cell
carcinoma. The third (removed after 56 weeks) was a
moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Initially,
xenografts of MCF10AneoT.TGl cells showed intraductal
proliferative changes; after 23 weeks, the lesions showed

histologic features resembling those seen in atypical
lineage of cells of three MCF10AneoT.TG1 xenografts
ysis. Conclusions: MCFIOAneoT and MCFlﬂAneoTJ‘Gl
a broad spectrum of human proliferative breast disease.
Implications: The reproducible establishment of repre-
sentative stages in early breast cancer progression from
the MCF10 model offers a new opportunity to analyze
critical events of carcinogenesis and progression in breast
cancer. [J Natl Cancer Inst 85:1725—1732, 1993]

 

Many human carcinomas evolve via a sequence from
benign hyperplasia through atypical hyperplasia to carcinoma
in situ and eventually to fully malignant, invasive tumors
with the potential to metastasizc. In the case of colorectal
is associated with a series of speciﬁc genetic alterations (1).
Although the colon cancer model has become a paradigm for
solid tumor development, deﬁnition of critical genetic events
in breast cancer has been hampered by the lengthy natural
history, architectural complexity, and relative inaccessibility
for sampling of breast cancers, particularly at the small,
early stages. In the human female breast, a spectrum of
pathologic change has been termed proliferative breast
disease. The progression of histopathologic features of
proliferative breast disease has been associated with
increased risk for the development of invasive carcinoma
(2). Women with the most severe form of proliferative breast
disease, atypical hyperplasia, have a fourfold to ﬁvefold
increased relative risk of developing breast cancer.

ABSTRACT

In the nematode Camw/tabditis elegam, germ cells normally adopt one o[ three fa mitosis, sperrnatt»
genesis or oogenesis. We have identiﬁed and characterized the gene [(2573, which is required for germ
cells to differentiate as sperm rather than as oocytes. Analysis of double nurttrnts suggests thatﬂygz? is
absolutely required for spermatogenesis and acts at the end of the regulatory hierarchy controlling sex
determination for the germ line. By contrast, mutations in fog-3 do not alter the sexual identity ofotlICt
tissues. \Ve also have characterized the null phenotype offag—J , another gene, required for spct’matogeuci
sis; we demonstrate that it too controls the sexual identity of germ cells but not of other tissues Finally,
we have studied the interaction of these two fog genes with gldil, a gene required for germ cells to
undergo oogenesis rather than mitosis. On the basis of these results, we propose that germfell fare
might be controlled by a set of inhibitory interactions among genes that specify one of three fines:

 

mitosis. spermatogenesis or oogenesis. Such 2r regulatory network would link the



sexual identity is crucial for the proper regulation
of many cell fates. In the nematode C, elegans, for exam-
ture, the neurons that control these muscles, the so—
matic gonad and the germ tissue all differ markedly
between the two sexes. These differences are controlled
autosornes ()lAlﬂ, and HERMAN 1979). Animals with
two X chromosomes and two sets of autosomes develop
as hertrraphrot',tes, whereas animals with one Xchro-
mosonic develop as males. This X :A signal is interpre-
ted by a set of regulatory genes that establish the sexual
identity of the animal (reviewed by lIODGKIN 1990;
Vtt.t.r L'\'li anti MEYER 1990; KUWABARA and KIMBLE
1992). We are interested in how the genes that control
sexual identity specify individual cell fates. To study this
process. we are analyzing the development of the germ
line.

Several factors make the germ line of C. elegans attraci

sperm, whereas in hermaphrodites the ﬁrst germ cells

Oaaracterization of the Proteins which are Closely Associated with Ligand-
Receptor Conplex in the Clathrin-Coated Structures in Huron KB Carcinoma
Cells.

Recently, the concept of toxin-unnocloml antibody conjugates sewing
as potential chenotheraputic agents has been shown to be experimentally
feasible. Several laboratories have successfully coupled cytotoxin
molecules to monoclonal antibodies or ligands that bind to specific cell
surface determinants or receptors. However, of major concern now is the
intracellular toxicity of these cytotoxic conjugates. Since most proteins
half life and toxicity of the cytotoxic conjugates would be greatly impaired
if these compounds followed this common intracellular pathway after
internalization. Imus, the development of a toxin-carrier which allows
cytotoxic conjugates to bypass lysomal degradation and effectively pass
into the cytoplasm has beomne an important subject in the developnent of
chemotheraputic agents. To approach this problem, understanding the
structure of clathrin-coated pits would be an appropriated begining at the

A primary observation frun Ira Pastan's laboratory has been shown that
epidermal growth factor (ass) and transferrin (TE) could be found in plasma
membrane coated pits (primary coated pits) at 6 min after ligand
(secondary coated pits) while '13? was localized in microtubule associated
vesicles. This observation clearly indicated that clathrin-coated
structures might play sane role in the sorting of internalized ligands. In
addition, some receptors, such as those for BGE‘ and TF, are randomly
distributed on the cell surface in the absence of lignd and only becane
concentrated (clustered) in coated pits in the presence of ligand. 'lhis
also indicates that coated pits can aggregate certain ligand—receptor
canplexes rather than unoccupied receptors. In order to have these sorting
processes, cells must have some specific proteins involved in these
processes. If it is the case, I believe that these specific proteins
involved in sorting ligand-receptor cunplenes must be closely associated
with the ligand-receptor cmuplex. lb draracterize these specific proteins,
the following experiments are proposed.

antibody. 'lhe immprecipitates will then be characterized on Sits-PAGE,

component was induced by anti-lg but not by CD40 ligand. Stimulated expression\of c-Fos and F053 was in all

_I_. WLTIFACTORIAL ETIOLOGY

Because of the problem of interrelationship, certain of the

suspected factors other than smoking will be mentioned briefly. The
objectives in doing so are:

(a) To emphasize the need for developing a perspective that
will lead to the eventual evaluation of the various
suspected factors as being independent, correlated,
cumulative, antagonistic or synergistic agents in the

origin and/or progressive development of cardiovascular
disease.

(b) To indicate possible variables in connection with which

smokers of various types and degrees may be contrasted
with non-smokers or with those who have discontinued
smoking for different periods of time.

Multifactorial Studies

 

Several multifactorial prospective studies, particularly those of
the Framingham group, of the Albany group, of Stamler and of Oglesby Paul have
endeavored to reach a profile description of the coronary-prone individual.
For such purposes, it has been necessary to employ available clinical
definitions of the various cardiovascular conditions, in order to relate

incidence epidemiologically to constitutional and environmental factors. In
general, the lack of autopsy data has been recognized as a serious handicap
to precise description and classification.

Some degree of success has been attained in reaching a profile
description. Hereditary factors seem to be quite generally recognized.
Epidemiologically, a rather persistent association between prevailing high
left ventricular hypertrophy, low vital capacity, history of shortness of
breath, history of peptic ulcer, history of chest discomfort, A-V nicking of
the fundi, and heavy use of coffee have been reported also to show various
degrees of association. Combinations of certain of these factors are
associated with higher risk in some reports, but not in others.

Of course, no studies of this kind can be used alone to determine
whether any one or any combination of the measured factors actually contri-
butes causally to production of disease or whether they tend rather to reflect
the existence of some constellation of more basic congenital predisposing
voluntary cessation of cigarette smoking may itself reflect selective
constitutional differences. The inevitable uncertainties inherent in these
studies are recognized as being a severe handicap to design of effective
preventive measures.

It is of interest that cigarette smoking does not appear to be
associated with development of chronic angina. Since this disease is
considered to be a consequence of general atherosclerotic narrowing of the
coronary arteries, this lack of association has been interpreted as indicating

TEST OF THE LINEAR-NO THRESHOLD THEORY OF RADIATION CARCINOGENESIS

We recently completed a compilation of radon measurements from available
sources which gives the average radon level, r. in homes for 1730 counties, well over
of age-adjusted lung cancer mortality rates, rn, vs these r are shown in Fig. 1a. c
where, rather than showing individual points for each county we have grouped them

into intervals of r (shown on the base-line along with .the number of counties in each

group) and we plot the mean value of m for each group, its standard deviation. and V

the ﬁrst and third quartiles of the distribution. We see, in Fig. 1a. c, a clear tendency
for m to decrease with increasing r. in sharp contrast to the increase expected from
the fact that radon can cause lung cancer. shown by the line labelled 'theory'.
One obvious problem is migration: people do not spend their whole life and
receive all of their radon exposure in their county of residence at time of death.

However, it is easy to correct the theoretical predication for this, and the “theory”

ABSTRACT To facilitate understanding of the mecha-
nisms underlying pulmonary diseases, including lung cancer
cultures of human tracheal epithelial cells. Cells were trans-
fected by calcium phosphate precipitation with a plasmid
containing a replication-defective simian virus 40 (SV40) ge-
isolated and analyzed for transformation- and epithelial-
specific characteristics. Precrisis cells were observed to express
the SV40 large tumor antigen, produce cytokeratins, have
microvilli, and form tight junctions. After crisis, cells contin-
ued to express the SV40 large tumor antigen as well as
epithelial-speciﬁc cytokeratins and to display the apical mem-
brane microvilli. Apical membrane Cl channels were opened in
postcrisis cells exposed to 50 MM forskolin. These channels
showed electrical properties similar to those observed in
primary cultures. The postcrisis cells have been in culture for
>250 generations and are potentially “immortal." In addition
to providing a useful in vitro model for the study of ion
transport by human airway epithelial cells. the cells can be used
to examine stages of neoplastic progression.

Such cells possess altered growth properties that can be
correlated with their neoplastic potential. Foreskin and
mammary epithelial cells treated with chemicals or radiation
show enhanced growth capacity (3, 4). Human keratinocytes
(5) have been immortalized with Harvey murine sarcoma
virus (v-Ha-ras). Human keratinocytes, immortalized with

antigen) three to four subcultures posttransfection (10).
A goal of the present study was to develop a transformed
human tracheal epithelial (HTE) cell line for detailed studies
of the mechanisms regulating C1 ion transport. This aspect of
epithelial function is essential for rehydration of airway
mucus. Abnormalities in the Cl conductance pathway also
appear critical to disease processes such as those occurring
in cystic ﬁbrosis (11, 12).

Phenotypic characteristics have been well maintained in
SV40—transformed ﬁbroblasts (13—15). In SV40—transformed
epithelial cells (16—19), certain aspects of phenotype are
tion (pSVori’) has been shown to enhance the transforma-
tion efﬁciency of human ﬁbroblasts (22). The defective origin
of replication precludes background virus replication and
eliminates the possibility of cell death or interference with
phenotypic expression in the host cell due to uncontrolled
viral DNA synthesis or production ofviral particles. We have
used the'pSVori’ plasmid to transform HTE cells. Trans
formed cells pass through a period of “crisis," after which
phenotype may change and loss of certain differentiated
functions may occur (21, 23). We have analyzed both pre- and
posterisis cells. Biochemical and morphological analyses
reveal that the cells retain some aspects of the original
phenotype even after crisis. These include the presence of
microvilli. responsiveness to neural agonists, keratin produc-
tion, and Cl ion transport.

METHODS

Cells and Culture Conditions. Cells were isolated from
trachea, as described, by enzymatic digestion (24) or as
outgrowths from tracheal tissue explants. Cells were plated
Waltham, MA), Vitrogen (GIBCO). and bovine serum albu-
under 5% col/95% air.

Pure cultures of epithelial cells were generated by elim-
inating contaminating ﬁbroblasts through selective detach-
ment (26). Pure cultures of epithelial cells were grown to 70%
or 80% conﬂuence before subculturing into lOO-mm Pctri

Transformation. The pSVori‘ plasmid was ampliﬁed in
bacteria and then isolated after banding on CsCl density
gradients (27). Since the transfection efﬁciency is increased
in linearized plasmids (22), pSVori _ was linearized with th)
I at a unique restriction enzyme site distal to the transforming
genes in the SV40 portion ofthe plasmid. The plasmid was cut
in a region distant to the SV40 genes to minimize endogenous
exonuclease damage to genes essential for transformation.
